<h1>INTRODUCTION - PART ONE</h1>

<p>
It is my privilege to enclose herewith Part One of The Master Key System. Would
you bring into your life more power, get the power consciousness, more health,
get the health consciousness, more happiness, get the happiness consciousness.
Live the spirit of these things until they become yours by right. It will then
become impossible to keep them from you. The things of the world are fluid to a
power within man by which he rules them. 
</p>

<p>
You need not acquire this power. You already have it. But you want to understand
it; you want to use it; you want to control it; you want to impregnate yourself
with it, so that you can go forward and carry the world before you. 
</p>

<p>
Day by day as you go on and on, as you gain momentum, as your inspiration
deepens, as your plans crystallize, as you gain understanding, you will come to
realize that this world is no dead pile of stones and timber, but that it is a
living thing! It is made up of the beating hearts of humanity. It is a thing of
life and beauty. 
</p>

<p>
It is evident that it requires understanding to work with material of this
description, but those who come into this understanding, are inspired by a new
light, a new force, they gain confidence and greater power each day, they
realize their hopes and their dreams come true, life has a deeper, fuller,
clearer meaning than before. 
And, now, Part One.... 
</p>

<h1>PART ONE </h1>

<p>
1. That much gathers more is true on every plane of existence and that loss
leads to greater loss is equally true. 
</p>

<p>
2. Mind is creative, and conditions, environment and all experiences in life are
the result of our habitual or predominant mental attitude. 
</p>

<p>
3. The attitude of mind necessarily depends upon what we think. Therefore, the
secret of all power, all achievement and all possession depends upon our method
of thinking. 
</p>

<p>
4. This is true because we must "be" before we can "do," and we can "do" only to
the extent which we "are," and what we "are" depends upon what we "think." 
</p>

<p>
5. We cannot express powers that we do not possess. The only way by which we may
secure possession of power is to become conscious of power, and we can never
become conscious of power until we learn that all power is from within. 
</p>

<p>
6. There is a world within – a world of thought and feeling and power; of light
and life and beauty and, although invisible, its forces are mighty. 
</p>

<p>
7. The world within is governed by mind. When we discover this world we shall
find the solution for every problem, the cause for every effect; and since the
world within is subject to our control, all laws of power and possession are
also within our control. 
</p>

<p>
8. The world without is a reflection of the world within. What appears without
is what has been found within. In the world within may be found infinite Wisdom,
infinite Power, infinite Supply of all that is necessary, waiting for
unfoldment, development and expression. If we recognize these potentialities in
the world within they will take form in the world without. 
</p>

<p>
9. Harmony in the world within will be reflected in the world without by
harmonious conditions, agreeable surroundings, the best of everything. It is the
foundation of health and a necessary essential to all greatness, all power, all
attainment, all achievement and all success. 
</p>

<p>
10. Harmony in the world within means the ability to control our thoughts, and
to determine for ourselves how any experience is to affect us. 
</p>

<p>
11. Harmony in the world within results in optimism and affluence; affluence
within results in affluence without. 
</p>

<p>
12. The world without reflects the circumstances and the conditions of the
consciousness within. 
</p>

<p>
13. If we find wisdom in the world within, we shall have the understanding to
discern the marvelous possibilities that are latent in this world within, and we
shall be given the power to make these possibilities manifest in the world
without. 
</p>

<p>
14. As we become conscious of the wisdom in the world within, we mentally take
possession of this wisdom, and by taking mental possession we come into actual
possession of the power and wisdom necessary to bring into manifestation the
essentials necessary for our most complete and harmonious development. 
</p>

<p>
15. The world within is the practical world in which the men and women of power
generate courage, hope, enthusiasm, confidence, trust and faith, by which they
are given the fine intelligence to see the vision and the practical skill to
make the vision real. 
</p>

<p>
16. Life is an unfoldment, not accretion. What comes to us in the world without
is what we already possess in the world within. 
</p>

<p>
17. All possession is based on consciousness. All gain is the result of an
accumulative consciousness. All loss is the result of a scattering
consciousness. 
</p>

<p>
18. Mental efficiency is contingent upon harmony; discord means confusion;
therefore, he who would acquire power must be in harmony with Natural Law. 
</p>

<p>
19. We are related to the world without by the objective mind. The brain is the
organ of this mind and the cerebro-spinal system of nerves puts us in conscious
communication with every part of the body. This system of 
nerves responds to every sensation of light, heat, odor, sound and taste. 
</p>

<p>
20. When this mind thinks correctly, when it understands the truth, when the
thoughts sent through the cerebro-spinal nervous system to the body are
constructive, these sensations are pleasant, harmonious. 
</p>

<p>
21. The result is that we build strength, vitality and all constructive forces
into our body, but it is through this same objective mind that all distress,
sickness, lack, limitation and every form of discord and inharmony is admitted
to our lives. It is therefore through the objective mind, by wrong thinking,
that we are related to all destructive forces. 
</p>

<p>
22. We are related to the world within by the subconscious mind. The solar
plexus is the organ of this mind; the sympathetic system of nerves presides over
all subjective sensations, such as joy, fear, love, emotion, respiration,
imagination and all other subconscious phenomena. It is through the subconscious
that we are connected with the Universal Mind and brought into relation with the
Infinite constructive forces of the Universe. 
</p>

<p>
23. It is the coordination of these two centers of our being, and the
understanding of their functions, which is the great secret of life. With this
knowledge we can bring the objective and subjective minds into conscious
cooperation and thus coordinate the finite and the infinite. Our future is
entirely within our own control. It is not at the mercy of any capricious or
uncertain external power. 
</p>

<p>
24. All agree that there is but one Principle or Consciousness pervading the
entire Universe, occupying all space, and being essentially the same in kind at
every point of its presence. It is all powerful, all wisdom and always present.
All thoughts and things are within Itself. It is all in all. 
</p>

<p>
25. There is but one consciousness in the universe able to think; and when it
thinks, its thoughts become objective things to it. As this Consciousness is
omnipresent, it must be present within every individual; each individual must be
a manifestation of that Omnipotent, Omniscient and Omnipresent Consciousness. 
</p>

<p>
26. As there is only one Consciousness in the Universe that is able to think it
necessarily follows that your consciousness is identical with the Universal
Consciousness, or, in other words, all mind is one mind. There is no dodging
this conclusion. 
</p>

<p>
27. The consciousness that focuses in your brain cells is the same consciousness
which focuses in the brain cells of every other individual. Each individual is
but the individualization of the Universal, the Cosmic Mind. 
</p>

<p>
28. The Universal Mind is static or potential energy; it simply is; it can
manifest only through the individual, and the individual can manifest only
through the Universal. They are one. 
</p>

<p>
29. The ability of the individual to think is his ability to act on the
Universal and bring it into manifestation. Human consciousness consists only in
the ability of man to think. Mind in itself is believed to be a subtle form of
static energy, from which arises the activities called 'thought, ' which is the
dynamic phase of mind. Mind is static energy, thought is dynamic energy -the two
phases of the same thing. Thought is therefore the vibratory force formed by
converting static mind into dynamic mind. 
</p>

<p>
30. As the sum of all attributes are contained in the Universal Mind, which is
Omnipotent, Omniscient and Omnipresent, these attributes must be present at all
times in their potential form in every individual. Therefore, when the
individual thinks, the thought is compelled by its nature to embody itself in an
objectivity or condition which will correspond with its origin. 
</p>

<p>
31. Every thought therefore is a cause and every condition an effect; for this
reason it is absolutely essential that you control your thoughts so as to bring
forth only desirable conditions. 
</p>

<p>
32. All power is from within, and is absolutely under your control; it comes
through exact knowledge and by the voluntary exercises of exact principles. 
</p>

<p>
33. It should be plain that when you acquire a thorough understanding of this
law, and are able to control your thought processes, you can apply it to any
condition; in other words, you will have come into conscious cooperation with
Omnipotent law which is the fundamental basis of all things. 
</p>

<p>
34. The Universal Mind is the life principle of every atom which is in
existence; every atom is continually striving to manifest more life; all are
intelligent, and all are seeking to carry out the purpose for which they were
created. 
</p>

<p>
35. A majority of mankind lives in the world without; few have found the world
within, and yet it is the world within that makes the world without; it is
therefore creative and everything which you find in your world without has been
created by you in the world within. 
</p>

<p>
36. This system will bring you into a realization of power which will be yours
when you understand this relation between the world without and the world
within. The world within is the cause, the world without the effect; to change
the effect you must change the cause. 
</p>

<p>
37. You will at once see that this is a radically new and different idea; most
men try to change effects by working with effects. They fail to see that this is
simply changing one form of distress for another. To remove discord, we must
remove the cause, and this cause can be found only in the world within. 
</p>

<p>
38. All growth is from within. This is evident in all nature. Every plant, every
animal, every human is a living testimony to this great law, and the error of
the ages is in looking for strength or power from without. 
</p>

<p>
39. The world within is the Universal fountain of supply, and the world without
is the outlet to the stream. Our ability to receive depends upon our recognition
of this Universal Fountain, this Infinite Energy of which each individual is an
outlet, and so is one with every other individual. 
</p>

<p>
40. Recognition is a mental process, mental action is therefore the interaction
of the individual upon the Universal Mind, and as the Universal Mind is the
intelligence which pervades all space and animates all living things, this
mental action and reaction is the law of causation, but the principle of
causation does not obtain in the individual but in the Universal Mind. It is not
an objective faculty but a subjective process, and the results are seen in an
infinite variety of conditions and experiences. 
</p>

<p>
41. In order to express life there must be mind; nothing can exist without mind.
Everything which exists is some manifestation of this one basic substance from
which and by which all things have been created and are continually being
recreated. 
</p>

<p>
42. We live in a fathomless sea of plastic mind substance. This substance is
ever alive and active. It is sensitive to the highest degree. It takes form
according to the mental demand. Thought forms the mold or matrix from which the
substance expresses. 
</p>

<p>
43. Remember that it is in the application alone that the value consists, and
that a practical understanding of this law will substitute abundance for
poverty, wisdom for ignorance, harmony for discord and freedom for tyranny, and
certainly there can be no greater blessing than these from a material and social
standpoint. 
</p>

<p>
44. Now make the application: Select a room where you can be alone and
undisturbed; sit erect, comfortably, but do not lounge; let your thoughts roam
where they will but be perfectly still for from fifteen minutes to half an hour;
continue this for three or four days or for a week until you secure full control
of your physical being. 
</p>

<p>
45. Many will find this extremely difficult; others will conquer with ease, but
it is absolutely essential to secure complete control of the body before you are
ready to progress. Next week you will receive instructions for the next step; in
the meantime you must have mastered this one.
