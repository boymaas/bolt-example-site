<h1>INTRODUCTION - PART TEN</h1>

<p>
If you get a thorough understanding or the thought contained in Part Ten, you
will have learned that nothing happens without a definite cause. You will be
enabled to formulate your plans in accordance with exact knowledge. You will
know how to control any situation by bringing adequate causes into play. When
you win, as you will, you will know exactly why. 
</p>

<p>
The ordinary man, who has no definite knowledge of cause and effect, is governed
by his feelings or emotions. He thinks chiefly to justify his action. If he
fails as a businessman, he says that luck is against him. If he dislikes music,
he says that music is an expensive luxury. If he is a poor office man, he says
that he could succeed better at some outdoor work. If he lacks friends, he says
his individuality is too fine to be appreciated. 
</p>

<p>
He never thinks his problem through to the end. In short, he does not know that
every effect is the result of a certain definite cause, but he seeks to console
himself with explanations and excuses. He thinks only in self-defense. 
</p>

<p>
On the contrary, the man who understands that there is no effect without an
adequate cause thinks impersonally. He gets down to bed rock facts regardless of
consequences. He is free to follow the trail of truth wherever it may lead. He
sees the issue clear to the end, and he meets the requirements fully and fairly,
and the result is that the world gives him all that it has to give, in
friendship, honor, love and approval.

<h1>PART TEN</h1>

<p>
1. Abundance is a natural law of the Universe. The evidence of this law is
conclusive; we see it on every hand. Everywhere Nature is lavish, wasteful,
extravagant. Nowhere is economy observed in any created thing. Profusion is
manifested in everything. The millions and millions of trees and flowers and
plants and animals and the vast scheme of reproduction where the process of
creating and recreating is forever going on, all indicates the lavishness with
which Nature has made provision for man. That there is an abundance for everyone
is evident, but that many fail to participate in this abundance is also evident;
they have not yet come into a realization of the Universality of all substance,
and that mind is the active principle whereby we are related to the things we
desire. 2. All wealth is the offspring of power; possessions are of value only
as they confer power. Events are significant only as they affect power; all
things represent certain forms and degrees of power. 3. Knowledge of cause and
effect as shown by the laws governing electricity, chemical affinity and
gravitation, enables man to plan courageously and execute fearlessly. These laws
are called Natural Laws, because they govern in the physical world, but all
power is not physical power; there is also mental power, and there is moral and
spiritual power. 4. Spiritual power is superior because it exists on a higher
plane. It has enabled man to discover the law by which these wonderful forces of
Nature could be harnessed and made to do the work of hundreds and thousands of
men. It has enabled man to discover laws whereby time and space have been
annihilated and the law of gravitation to be overcome. The operation of this law
is dependent upon spiritual contact, as Henry Drummond well says: 5. "In the
physical world as we know it, there exists the organic and the inorganic. The
inorganic of the mineral world is absolutely cut off from the plant or animal
world; the passage is hermetically sealed. These barriers have never yet been
crossed. No change of substance, no modification of environment, no chemistry,
no electricity, no form of energy, no evolution of any kind can ever endow a
single atom of the mineral world with the attribute of Life.” 6. "Only by the
bending down into this dead world of some living form can those dead atoms be
gifted with the properties of vitality; without this contact with life they
remain fixed in the inorganic sphere forever. Huxley says that the doctrine of
Biogenesis (or life only from life) is victorious all along the line, and
Tyndall is compelled to say: 'I affirm that no shred of trustworthy evidence
exists to prove that life in our day has ever appeared independent of antecedent
life.' 7. "Physical laws may explain the inorganic, Biology explains and
accounts for the development of the organic, but of the point of contact Science
is silent. A similar passage exists between the Natural world and the Spiritual
world; this passage is hermetically sealed on the natural side. The door is
closed; no man can open it, no organic change, no mental energy, no moral
effort, no progress of any kind can enable any human being to enter the
spiritual world."
</p>

<p>
8. But as the plant reaches down into the mineral world and touches it with the
mystery of Life, so the Universal Mind reaches down into the human mind and
endows it with new, strange, wonderful and even marvelous qualities. All men or
women who have every accomplished anything in the world of industry, commerce or
art have accomplished because of this process. 
</p>

<p>
9. Thought is the connecting link between the Infinite and the finite, between
the Universal and the individual. We have seen that there is an impassable
barrier between the organic and the inorganic, and that the only way that matter
can unfold is to be impregnated with life; as a seed reaches down into the
mineral world and begins to unfold and reach out, the dead matter begins to
live, a thousand invisible fingers begin to weave a suitable environment for the
new arrival, and as the law of growth begins to take effect, we see the process
continue until the Lily finally appears, and even "Solomon in all his glory was
not arrayed like one of these".
</p>

<p>
10. Even so, a thought is dropped into the invisible substance of the Universal
Mind, that substance from which all things are created, and as it takes root,
the law of growth begins to take effect and we find that conditions and
environment are but the objective form of our thought. 
</p>

<p>
11. The law is that Thought is an active vital form of dynamic energy which has
the power to correlate with its object and bring it out of the invisible
substance from which all things are created into the visible or objective world.
This is the law by which, and through which all things come into manifestation;
it is the Master Key by which you are admitted into the Secret Place of the Most
High and are "given dominion over all things." With an understanding of this law
you may "decree a thing and it shall be established unto thee." 
</p>

<p>
12. It could not be otherwise; if the soul of the Universe as we know it is the
Universal Spirit, then the Universe is simply the condition which the Universal
Spirit has made for itself. We are simply individualized spirit and are creating
the conditions for our growth in exactly the same way.
</p>

<p>
13. This creative power depends upon our recognition of the potential power of
spirit or mind and must not be confused with Evolution. Creation is the calling
into existence of that which does not exist in the objective world. Evolution is
simply the unfolding of potentialities involved in things which already exist. 
</p>

<p>
14. In taking advantage of the wonderful possibilities opened up to us through
the operation of this law, we must remember that we ourselves contribute nothing
to its efficacy as the Great Teacher said: "It is not I that doeth the works,
but the Father that dwelleth in me, He doeth the work". We must take exactly the
same position; we can do nothing to assist in the manifestation, we simply
comply with the law, and the All-originating Mind will bring about the result. 
</p>

<p>
15. The great error of the present day is the idea that Man has to originate the
intelligence whereby the Infinite can proceed to bring about a specific purpose
or result. Nothing of this kind is necessary; the Universal Mind can be depended
upon to find the ways and means for bringing about any necessary manifestation.
We must, however, create the ideal, and this ideal should be perfect. 
</p>

<p>
16. We know that the laws governing Electricity have been formulated in such a
way that this invisible power can be controlled and used for our benefit and
comfort in thousands of ways. We know that messages are carried around the
world, that ponderous machinery does its bidding, that it now illuminates
practically the whole world, but we know too that if we consciously or
ignorantly violate its law by touching a live wire, when it is not properly
insulated, the result will be unpleasant and possibly disastrous. A lack of
understanding of the laws governing in the invisible world has the same result,
and many are suffering the consequences all the time. 
</p>

<p>
17. It has been explained that the law of causation depends upon polarity, a
circuit must be formed; this circuit cannot be formed unless we operate in
harmony with the law. How shall we operate in harmony with the law unless we
know what the law is? How shall we know what the Law is? By study, by
observation. 
</p>

<p>
18. We see the law in operation everywhere; all nature testifies to the
operation of the law by silently, constantly expressing itself in the law of
growth. Where there is growth, there must be life; where there is life there
must be harmony, so that everything that has life is constantly attracting to
itself the conditions and the supply which is necessary for its most complete
expression. 
</p>

<p>
19. If your thought is in harmony with the creative Principle of Nature, it is
in tune with the Infinite Mind, and it will form the circuit, it will not return
to you void; but it is possible for you to think thoughts that are not in tune
with the Infinite, and when there is no polarity, the circuit is not formed.
What, then, is the result? What is the result when a dynamo is generating
electricity, the circuit is cut off and there is no outlet? The dynamo stops.
</p>

<p>
20. It will be exactly the same with you, if you entertain thoughts which are
not in accordance with the Infinite and cannot therefore be polarized; there is
no circuit, you are isolated, the thoughts cling to you, harass you, worry you,
and finally bring about disease and possibly death; the physician may not
diagnose the case exactly in this way, he may give it some fancy name which has
been manufactured for the various ills which are the result of wrong thinking,
but the cause is the same nevertheless. 
</p>

<p>
21. Constructive thought must necessarily be creative, but creative thought must
be harmonious, and this eliminates all destructive or competitive thought. 
</p>

<p>
22. Wisdom, strength, courage and all harmonious conditions are the result of
power and we have seen that all power is from within; likewise, every lack,
limitation or adverse circumstance is the result of weakness, and weakness is
simply absence of power; it comes from nowhere, it is nothing -- the remedy then
is simply to develop power, and this is accomplished in exactly the same manner
that all power is developed, by exercise. 
</p>

<p>
23. This exercise consists in making an application of your knowledge. Knowledge
will not apply itself. You must make the application. Abundance will not come to
you out of the sky, neither will it drop into your lap, but a conscious
realization of the law of attraction and the intention to bring it into
operation for a certain, definite and specific purpose, and the will to carry
out this purpose will bring about the materialization of your desire by a
natural law of transference. If you are in business, it will increase and
develop along regular channels, possibly new or unusual channels of distribution
will be opened and when the law becomes fully operative, you will find that the
things you seek are seeking you. 
</p>

<p>
24. This week select a blank space on the wall, or any other convenient spot,
from where you usually sit, mentally draw a black horizontal line about six
inches long, try to see the line as plainly as though it were painted on the
wall; now mentally draw two vertical lines connecting with this horizontal line
at either end; now draw another horizontal line connecting with the two vertical
lines; now you have a square. Try to see the square perfectly; when you can do
so draw a circle within the square; now place a point in the center of the
circle; now draw the point toward you about 10 inches; now you have a cone on a
square base; you will remember that your work was all in black; change it to
white, to red, to yellow. 
</p>

<p>
25. If you can do this, you are making excellent progress and will soon be
enabled to concentrate on any problem you may have in mind. "When any object or
purpose is clearly held in thought, its precipitation, in tangible and visible
form, is merely a question of time. 
</p>

</p>

<p>
99. What is the remedy? A conscious recognition of the law of attraction with
the intention of bring it into existence for a definite purpose. 
</p>

<p>
100. What will be the result? Thought will correlate with its object and bring
