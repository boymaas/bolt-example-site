<h1>INTRODUCTION - PART SEVEN</h1>

<p>
Through all the ages man has believed in an invisible power, through which and
by which all things have been created and are continually being re-created.
</p>

<p>
We may personalize this power and call it God, or we may think of it as the
essence or spirit, which permeates all things, but in either case the effect is
the same. 
</p>

<p>
So far as the individual is concerned, the objective, the physical, the visible,
is the personal, that which can be cognized by the senses. It consists of body,
brain and nerves. The subjective is the spiritual, the invisible, the
impersonal. 
</p>

<p>
The personal is conscious because it is a personal entity. The impersonal, being
the same in kind and quality as all other Being, is not conscious of itself and
has therefore been termed the subconscious. The personal, or conscious, has the
power of will and choice, and can therefore exercise discrimination in the
selection of methods whereby to bring about the solution of difficulties. The
impersonal, or spiritual, being a part or one with the source, and origin of all
power, can necessarily exercise no such choice, but, on the contrary, it has
Infinite resources at its command. It can and does bring about results by
methods concerning which the human or individual mind can have no possible
conception.
</p>

<p>
You will therefore see that it is your privilege to depend upon the human will
with all its limitations and misconceptions, or you may utilize the
potentialities of Infinity by making use of the subconscious mind. Here, then,
is the scientific explanation of the wonderful power which has been put within
your control, if you but understand, appreciate and recognize it.
</p>

<p>
One method of consciously utilizing this omnipotent power is outlined in Part
Seven.
</p>

<h1>PART SEVEN</h1>

<p>
1. Visualization is the process of making mental images, and the image is the
mold or model which will serve as a pattern from which your future will emerge. 
</p>

<p>
2. Make the pattern clear and make it beautiful; do not be afraid; make it
grand; remember that no limitation can be placed upon you by any one but
yourself; you are not limited as to cost or material; draw on the Infinite for
your supply, construct it in your imagination; it will have to be there before
it will ever appear anywhere else. 
</p>

<p>
3. Make the image clear and clean-cut, hold it firmly in the mind and you will
gradually and constantly bring the thing nearer to you. You can be what "you
will to be." 
</p>

<p>
4. This is another psychological fact which is well known, but unfortunately,
reading about it will not bring about any result which you may have in mind; it
will not even help you to form the mental image, much less bring it into
manifestation. Work is necessary - labor, hard mental labor, the kind of effort
which so few are willing to put forth.
</p>

<p>
5. The first step is idealization. It is likewise the most important step,
because it is the plan on which you are going to build. It must be solid; it
must be permanent. The architect, when he plans a 30-story building, has every
line and detail pictured in advance. The engineer, when he spans a chasm, first
ascertains the strength requirements of a million separate parts. 
</p>

<p>
6. They see the end before a single step is taken; so you are to picture in your
mind what you want; you are sowing the seed, but before sowing any seed you want
to know what the harvest is to be. This is Idealization. If you are not sure,
return to the chair daily until the picture becomes plain; it will gradually
unfold; first the general plan will be dim, but it will take shape, the outline
will take form, then the details, and you will gradually develop the power by
which you will be enabled to formulate plans which will eventually materialize
in the objective world. You will come to know what the future holds for you. 
</p>

<p>
7. Then comes the process of visualization. You must see the picture more and
more complete, see the detail, and, as the details begin to unfold the ways and
means for bringing it into manifestation will develop. One thing will lead to
another. Thought will lead to action, action will develop methods, methods will
develop friends, and friends will bring about circumstances, and, finally, the
third step, or Materialization, will have been accomplished.
</p>

<p>
8. We all recognize the Universe must have been thought into shape before it
ever could have become a material fact. And if we are willing to follow along
the lines of the Great Architect of the Universe, we shall find our thoughts
taking form, just as the universe took concrete form. It is the same mind
operating through the individual. There is no difference in kind or quality, the
only difference is one of degree. 
</p>

<p>
9. The architect visualizes his building, he sees it as he wishes it to be. His
thought becomes a plastic mold from which the building will eventually emerge, a
high one or a low one, a beautiful one or a plain one, his vision takes form on
paper and eventually the necessary material is utilized and the building stands
complete. 
</p>

<p>
10. The inventor visualizes his idea in exactly the same manner, for instance,
Nikola Tesla, he with the giant intellect, one of the greatest inventors of all
ages, the man who has brought forth the most amazing realities, always
visualizes his inventions before attempting to work them out. He did not rush to
embody them in form and then spend his time in correcting defects. Having first
built up the idea in his imagination, he held it there as a mental picture, to
be reconstructed and improved by his thought. "In this way," he writes in the
Electrical Experimenter. "I am enabled to rapidly develop and perfect a
conception without touching anything. When I have gone so far as to embody in
the invention every possible improvement I can think of, and see no fault
anywhere, I put into concrete, the product of my brain. Invariably my devise
works as I conceived it should; in twenty years there has not been a single
exception." 
</p>

<p>
11. If you can conscientiously follow these directions, you will develop Faith,
the kind of Faith that is the "Substance of things hoped for, the evidence of
things not seen"; you will develop confidence, the kind of confidence that leads
to endurance and courage; you will develop the power of concentration which will
enable you to exclude all thoughts except the ones which are associated with
your purpose.
</p>

<p>
12. The law is that thought will manifest in form, and only one who knows how to
be the divine thinker of his own thoughts can ever take a Master's place and
speak with authority.
</p>

<p>
13. Clearness and accuracy are obtained only by repeatedly having the image in
mind. Each repeated action renders the image more clear and accurate than the
preceding, and in proportion to the clearness and accuracy of the image will the
outward manifestation be. You must build it firmly and securely in your mental
world, the world within, before it can take form in the world without, and you
can build nothing of value, even in the mental world unless you have the proper
material. When you have the material you can build anything you wish, but make
sure of your material. You cannot make broadcloth from shoddy. 
</p>

<p>
14. This material will be brought out by millions of silent mental workers and
fashioned into the form of the image which you have in mind. 
</p>

<p>
15. Think of it! You have over five million of these mental workers, ready and
in active use; brain cells they are called. Besides this, there is another
reserve force of at least an equal number, ready to be called into action at the
slightest need. Your power to think, then, is almost unlimited, and this means
that your power to create the kind of material which is necessary to build for
yourself any kind of environment which you desire is practically unlimited. 
</p>

<p>
16. In addition to these millions of mental workers, you have billions of mental
workers in the body, every one of which is endowed with sufficient intelligence
to understand and act upon any message or suggestion given. These cells are all
busy creating and recreating the body, but, in addition to this, they are
endowed with psychic activity whereby they can attract to themselves the
substance necessary for perfect development.
</p>

<p>
17. They do this by the same law and in the same manner that every form of life
attracts to itself the necessary material for growth. The oak, the rose, the
lily, all require certain material for their most perfect expression and they
secure it by silent demand, the Law of Attraction, the most certain way for you
to secure what you require for your most complete development. 
</p>

<p>
18. Make the Mental Image; make it clear, distinct, perfect; hold it firmly; the
ways and means will develop; supply will follow the demand; you will be led to
do the right thing at the right time and in the right way. Earnest Desire will
bring about Confident Expectation, and this in turn must be reinforced by Firm
Demand. These three cannot fail to bring about Attainment, because the Earnest
Desire is the feeling, the Confident Expectation is the thought, and the Firm
Demand is the will, and, as we have seen, feeling gives vitality to thought and
the will holds it steadily until the law of Growth brings it into manifestation. 
</p>

<p>
19. Is it not wonderful that man has such tremendous power within himself, such
transcendental faculties concerning which he had no conception? Is it not
strange that we have always been taught to look for strength and power
"without?" We have been taught to look everywhere but "within" and whenever this
power manifested in our lives we were told that it was something supernatural. 
</p>

<p>
20. There are many who have come to an understanding of this wonderful power,
and who make serious and conscientious efforts to realize health, power and
other conditions, and seem to fail. They do not seem able to bring the Law into
operation. The difficulty in nearly every case is that they are dealing with
externals. They want money, power, health and abundance, but they fail to
realize that these are effects and can come only when the cause is found. 
</p>

<p>
21. Those who will give no attention to the world without will seek only to
ascertain the truth, will look only for wisdom, will find that this wisdom will
unfold and disclose the source of all power, that it will manifest in thought
and purpose which will create the external conditions desired. This truth will
find expression in noble purpose and courageous action.
</p>

<p>
22. Create ideals only, give no thought to external conditions, make the world
within beautiful and opulent and the world without will express and manifest the
condition which you have within. You will come into a realization of your power
to create ideals and these ideals will be projected into the world of effect.
</p>

<p>
23. For instance, a man is in debt. He will be continually thinking about the
debt, concentrating on it, and as thoughts are causes the result is that he not
only fastens the debt closer to him, but actually creates more debt. He is
putting the great law of Attraction into operation with the usual and inevitable
result -- Loss leads to greater "Loss." 
</p>

<p>
24. What, then, is the correct principle? Concentrate on the things you want,
not on the things you do not want. Think of abundance; idealize the methods and
plans for putting the Law of Abundance into operation. Visualize the condition
which the Law of Abundance creates; this will result in manifestation. 
</p>

<p>
25. If the law operates perfectly to bring about poverty, lack and every form of
limitation for those who are continually entertaining thoughts of lack and fear,
it will operate with the same certainty to bring about conditions of abundance
and opulence for those who entertain thoughts of courage and power.
</p>

<p>
26. This is a difficult problem for many; we are too anxious; we manifest
anxiety, fear, distress; we want to do something; we want to help; we are like a
child who has just planted a seed and every fifteen minutes goes and stirs up
the earth to see if it is growing. Of course, under such circumstances, the seed
will never germinate, and yet this is exactly what many of us do in the mental
world. 
</p>

<p>
27. We must plant the seed and leave it undisturbed. This does not mean that we
are to sit down and do nothing, by no means; we will do more and better work
then we have ever done before, new channels will constantly be provided, new
doors will open; all that is necessary is to have an open mind, be ready to act
when the time comes. 
</p>

<p>
28. Thought force is the most powerful means of obtaining knowledge, and if
concentrated on any subject will solve the problem. Nothing is beyond the power
of human comprehension, but in order to harness thought force and make it do
your bidding, work is required.
</p>

<p>
29. Remember that thought is the fire that creates the steam that turns the
wheel of fortune, upon which your experiences depend.
</p>

<p>
30. Ask yourself a few questions and then reverently await the response; do you
not now and then feel the self with you? Do you assert this self or do you
follow the majority? Remember that majorities are always led, they never lead.
It was the majority that fought, tooth and nail, against the steam engine, the
power loom and every other advance or improvement ever suggested. 
</p>

<p>
31. For your exercise this week, visualize your friend, see him exactly as you
last saw him, see the room, the furniture, recall the conversation, now see his
face, see it distinctly, now talk to him about some subject of mutual interest;
see his expression change, watch him smile. Can you do this? All right, you can;
then arouse his interest, tell him a story of adventure, see his eyes light up
with the spirit of fun or excitement. Can you do all of this? If so, your
imagination is good, you are making excellent progress.

61. What is visualization? The process of making mental pictures. 
</p>

<p>
62. What is the result of this method of thought? By holding the image or
picture in mind, we can gradually but surely bring the thing nearer to us. We
can be what we will to be.
