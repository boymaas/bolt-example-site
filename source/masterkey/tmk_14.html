<h1>INTRODUCTION - PART FOURTEEN </h1>

<p>
You have found from your study thus far that thought is a spiritual activity and
is therefore endowed with creative power. This does not mean that some thought
is creative, but that all thought is creative. This same principle can be
brought into operation in a negative way, through the process of denial. 
</p>

<p>
The conscious and subconscious are but two phases of action in connection with
one mind. The relation of the subconscious to the conscious is quite analogous
to that existing between a weather vane and the atmosphere. Just as the least
pressure of the atmosphere causes an action on the part of the weather vane, so
does the least thought entertained by the conscious mind produce within your
subconscious mind action in exact proportion to the depth of feeling
characterizing the thought and the intensity with which the thought is indulged. 
</p>

<p>
It follows that if you deny unsatisfactory conditions, you are withdrawing the
creative power of your thought from these conditions. You are cutting them away
at the root. You are sapping their vitality. 
</p>

<p>
Remember that the law of growth necessarily governs every manifestation in the
objective, so that a denial of unsatisfactory conditions will not bring about
instant change. A plant will remain visible for some time after its roots have
been cut, but it will gradually fade away and eventually disappear, so the
withdrawal of your thought from the contemplation of unsatisfactory conditions
will gradually, but surely, terminate these conditions.
</p>

<p>
You will see that this is an exactly opposite course from the one which we would
naturally be inclined to adopt. It will therefore have an exactly opposite
effect to the one usually secured. Most persons concentrate intently upon
unsatisfactory conditions, thereby giving the condition that measure of energy
and vitality which is necessary in order to supply a vigorous growth.

<p>
1. The Universal Energy in which all motion, light, heat, and color have their
origin, does not partake of the limitation of the many effects of which it is
the cause, but it is supreme over them all. This Universal Substance is the
source of all Power, Wisdom and Intelligence. 
</p>

<p>
2. To recognize this Intelligence is to acquaint yourself with the knowing
quality of Mind and through it to move upon the Universal Substance, and bring
it into harmonious relations in your affairs.
</p>

<p>
3. This is something that the most learned physical science teacher has not
attempted -- a field of discovery upon which he has not yet launched; in fact,
but few of the materialistic schools have ever caught the first ray of this
light. It does not seem to have dawned upon them that wisdom is just as much
present everywhere as are force and substance. 
</p>

<p>
4. Some will say, if these principles are true, why are we not demonstrating
them? As the fundamental principle is obviously correct, why do we not get
proper results? We do. We get results in exact accordance with our understanding
of the law and our ability to make the proper application. We secured no results
from the laws governing electricity until someone formulated the law and showed
us how to apply it. 
</p>

<p>
5. This puts us in an entirely new relation to our environment, opening up
possibilities previously undreamed of, and this by an orderly sequence of law
which is naturally involved in our new mental attitude. 
</p>

<p>
6. Mind is creative and the principle upon which this law is based is sound and
legitimate and is inherent in the nature of things; but this creative power does
not originate in the individual, but in the Universal, which is the source and
fountain of all energy and substance, the individual is simply the channel for
the distribution of this energy. The individual is the means by which the
Universal produces the various combinations which result in the formation of
phenomena. 
</p>

<p>
7. We know that scientists have resolved matter into an immense number of
molecules; these molecules have been resolved into atoms, and the atoms into
electrons. The discovery of electrons in high vacuum glass tubes containing
fused terminals of hard metal, indicates conclusively that these electrons fill
all space; that they exist everywhere, that they are omnipresent. They fill all
material bodies and occupy the whole of what we call empty space. This, then, is
the Universal Substance from which all things proceed. 
</p>

<p>
8. Electrons would forever remain electrons unless directed where to go to be
assembled into atoms and molecules, and this director is Mind. A number of
electrons revolving around a center of force constitutes an atom; atoms unite in
absolutely regular mathematical ratios and form molecules, and these unite with
each other to form a multitude of compounds which unite to build the Universe. 
</p>

<p>
9. The lightest known atom is hydrogen and this is 1,700 times heavier than an
electron. An atom of mercury is 300,000 times heavier than an electron.
Electrons are pure negative electricity, and as they have the same potential
velocity as all other cosmic energy, such as heat, light, electricity and
thought (189,380 miles per second), neither time nor space require
consideration. The manner in which the velocity of light was ascertained is
interesting. 
</p>

<p>
10. The velocity of light was obtained by the Danish astronomer Roemer in 1676,
by observing the eclipses of Jupiter's moons. When the earth was nearest to
Jupiter, the eclipse appeared about eight and one-half minutes too soon for the
calculations, and when the earth was most remote from Jupiter, they were about
eight and one-half minutes too late. Roemer concluded the reason to be that it
required 17 minutes for light from the planet to traverse the diameter of the
earth's orbit, which measured the difference of the distances of the earth from
Jupiter. This calculation has since been verified, and proves that light travels
about 186,000 miles a second. 
</p>

<p>
11. Electrons manifest in the body as cells, and possess mind and intelligence
sufficient for them to perform their functions in the human physical anatomy.
Every part of the body is composed of cells, some of which operate
independently; others in communities. Some are busy building tissue, while
others are engaged in forming the various secretions necessary for the body.
Some act as carriers of material; others are the surgeons whose work it is to
repair damage; others are scavengers, carrying off waste; others are constantly
ready to repel invaders or other undesirable intruders of the germ family.
</p>

<p>
12. All these cells are moving for a common purpose and each one is not only a
living organism, but has sufficient intelligence to enable it to perform its
necessary duties. It is also endowed with sufficient intelligence to conserve
the energies and perpetuate its own life. It must, therefore, secure sufficient
nourishment and it has been found that it exercises choice in the selection of
such nourishment. 
</p>

<p>
13. Each cell is born, reproduces itself, dies and is absorbed. The maintenance
of health and life itself depends upon the constant regeneration of these cells.
</p>

<p>
14. It is therefore apparent that there is mind in every atom of the body; this
mind is negative mind, and the power of the individual to think makes him
positive, so that he can control this negative mind. This is the scientific
explanation for metaphysical healing, and will enable anyone to understand the
principle upon which this remarkable phenomenon rests. 
</p>

<p>
15. This negative mind, which is contained in every cell of the body, has been
called the subconscious mind, because it acts without our conscious knowledge.
We have found that this subconscious mind is responsive to the will of the
conscious mind.
</p>

<p>
16. All things have their origin in mind, and appearances are the result of
thought. So that we see that things in themselves have no origin, permanency, or
reality. Since they are produced by thought, they can be erased by thought. 
</p>

<p>
17. In mental, as in natural science, experiments are being made and each
discovery lifts man one step higher toward his possible goal. We find that every
man is the reflection of the thought he has entertained during his lifetime.
This is stamped on his face, his form, his character, his environment. 18. Back
of every effect there is a cause, and if we follow the trail to its starting
point, we shall find the creative principle out of which it grew. Proofs of this
are now so complete that this truth is generally accepted. 
</p>

<p>
19. The objective world is controlled by an unseen and, heretofore,
unexplainable power. We have, heretofore, personalized this power and called it
God. We have now, however, learned to look upon it as the permeating essence or
Principle of all that exists -- the Infinite or Universal Mind. 
</p>

<p>
20. The Universal Mind, being infinite and omnipotent, has unlimited resources
at its command, and when we remember that it is also omnipresent, we cannot
escape the conclusion that we must be an expression or manifestation of that
Mind. 
</p>

<p>
21. A recognition and understanding of the resources of the subconscious mind
will indicate that the only difference between the subconscious and the
Universal is one of degree. They differ only as a drop of water differs from the
ocean. They are the same in kind and quality, the difference is one of degree
only. 
</p>

<p>
22. Do you, can you, appreciate the value of this all-important fact; do you
realize that a recognition of this tremendous fact places you in touch with
Omnipotence? The subconscious mind being the connecting link between the
Universal Mind and the conscious mind, is it not evident that the conscious mind
can consciously suggest thoughts which the subconscious mind will put into
action, and as the subconscious is one with the Universal, is it not evident
that no limit can be placed upon its activities? 
</p>

<p>
23. A scientific understanding of this principle will explain the wonderful
results which are secured through the power of prayer. The results which are
secured in this way are not brought about by any special dispensations of
providence, but on the contrary, they are the result of the operation of a
perfectly natural law. There is, therefore, nothing either religious or
mysterious about it. 
</p>

<p>
24. Yet there are many who are not ready to enter into the discipline necessary
to think correctly, even though it is evident that wrong thinking has brought
failure.
</p>

<p>
25. Thought is the only reality; conditions are but the outward manifestations;
as the thought changes, all outward or material conditions must change in order
to be in harmony with their creator, which is thought. 
</p>

<p>
26. But the thought must be clear cut, steady, fixed, definite, unchangeable;
you cannot take one step forward and two steps backward, neither can you spend
twenty or thirty years of your life building up negative conditions as the
result of negative thoughts, and then expect to see them all melt away as the
result of fifteen or twenty minutes of right thinking.
</p>

<p>
27. If you enter into the discipline necessary to bring about a radical change
in your life, you must do so deliberately, after giving the matter careful
thought and full consideration, and then you must allow nothing to interfere
with your decision.
</p>

<p>
28. This discipline, this change of thought, this mental attitude will not only
bring you the material things which are necessary for your highest and best
welfare, but will bring health and harmonious conditions generally. 
</p>

<p>
29. If you wish harmonious conditions in your life, you must develop an
harmonious mental attitude. 
</p>

<p>
30. Your world without will be a reflection of your world within. 
</p>

<p>
31. For your exercise this week, concentrate on Harmony, and when I say
concentrate, I mean all that the word implies; concentrate so deeply, so
earnestly, that you will be conscious of nothing but harmony. Remember, we learn
by doing. Reading these lessons will get you nowhere. It is in the practical
application that the value consists.
