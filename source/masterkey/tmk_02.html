<h1>INTRODUCTION - PART TWO</h1>

<p>
Our difficulties are largely due to confused ideas and ignorance of our true
interests. The great task is to discover the laws of nature to which we are to
adjust ourselves. Clear thinking and moral insight are, therefore, of
incalculable value. All processes, even those of thought, rest on solid
foundations. 
</p>

<p>
The keener the sensibilities, the more acute the judgment, the more delicate the
taste, the more refined the moral feelings, the more subtle the intelligence,
the loftier the aspiration--the purer and more intense are the gratifications
which existence yields. Hence it is that the study of the best that has been
thought in the world gives supreme pleasure. 
</p>

<p>
The powers, uses and possibilities of the mind under the new interpretations are
incomparably more wonderful that the most extravagant accomplishment, or even
dreams of material progress. Thought is energy. Active thought is active energy;
concentrated thought is a concentrated energy. Thought concentrated on a
definite purpose becomes power. This is the power which is being used by those
who do not believe in the virtue of poverty, or the beauty of self-denial. They
perceive that this is the talk of weaklings.
</p>

<p>
The ability to receive and manifest this power depends upon the ability to
recognize the Infinite Energy ever dwelling in man, constantly creating and
recreating his body and mind, and ready at any moment to manifest through him in
any needful manner. In exact proportion to the recognition of this truth will be
the manifestation in the outer life of the individual. 
</p>

<p>
Part two explains the method by which this is accomplished. 
</p>

<h1>PART TWO </h1>

<p>
1. The operations of the mind are produced by two parallel modes of activity,
the one conscious, and the other subconscious. Professor Davidson says: "He who
thinks to illuminate the whole range of mental action by the light of his own
consciousness is not unlike the one who should go about to illuminate the
universe with a rushlight." 
</p>

<p>
2. The subconscious' logical processes are carried on with a certainty and
regularity which would be impossible if there existed the possibility of error.
Our mind is so designed that it prepares for us the most important foundations
of cognition, whilst we have not the slightest apprehension of the modus
operandi. 
</p>

<p>
3. The subconscious soul, like a benevolent stranger, works and makes provision
for our benefit, pouring only the mature fruit into our lap; thus ultimate
analysis of thought processes shows that the subconscious is the theatre of the
most important mental phenomena.
</p>

<p>
4. It is through the subconscious that Shakespeare must have perceived, without
effort, great truths which are hidden from the conscious mind of the student;
that Phidias fashioned marble and bronze; that Raphael painted Madonnas and
Beethoven composed symphonies.
</p>

<p>
5. Ease and perfection depend entirely upon the degree in which we cease to
depend upon the consciousness; playing the piano, skating, operating the
typewriter, the skilled trades, depend for their perfect execution on the
process of the sub-conscious mind. The marvel of playing a brilliant piece on
the piano, while at the same time conducting a vigorous conversation, shows the
greatness of our subconscious powers. 
</p>

<p>
6. We are all aware how dependent we are upon the subconscious, and the greater,
the nobler, the more brilliant our thoughts are, the more it is obvious to
ourselves that the origin lies beyond our ken. We find ourselves endowed with
tact, instinct, sense of the beautiful in art, music, etc., or whose origin or
dwelling place we are wholly unconscious. 
</p>

<p>
7. The value of the subconscious is enormous; it inspires us; it warns us; it
furnishes us with names, facts and scenes from the storehouse of memory. It
directs our thoughts, tastes, and accomplishes tasks so intricate that no
conscious mind, even if it had the power, has the capacity for.
</p>

<p>
8. We can walk at will; we can raise the arm whenever we choose to do so; we can
give our attention through eye or ear to any subject at pleasure. On the other
hand, we cannot stop our heartbeats nor the circulation of the blood, nor the
growth of stature, nor the formation of nerve and muscle tissue, nor the
building of the bones, nor many other important vital processes. 
</p>

<p>
9. If we compare these two sets of action, the one decreed by the will of the
moment, and the other proceeding in majestic, rhythmic course, subject to no
vascillation, but constant at every moment, we stand in awe of the latter, and
ask to have the mystery explained. We see at once that these are the vital
processes of our physical life, and we cannot avoid the inference that these
all-important functions are designedly withdrawn from the domain of our outward
will with its variations and transitions, and placed under the direction of a
permanent and dependable power within us. 
</p>

<p>
10. Of these two powers, the outward and changeable has been termed the
"Conscious Mind," or the "Objective Mind" (dealing with outward objects). The
interior power is called the "Subconscious Mind," or the "Subjective Mind," and
besides its work on the mental plane it controls the regular functions which
make physical life possible. 
</p>

<p>
11. It is necessary to have a clear understanding of their respective functions
on the mental plane, as well as of certain other basic principles. Perceiving
and operating through the five physical senses, the conscious mind deals with
the impressions and objects of the outward life. 
</p>

<p>
12. It has the faculty of discrimination, carrying with it the responsibility of
choice. It has the power of reasoning--whether inductive, deductive, analytical
or syllogistic--and this power may be developed to a high degree. It is the seat
of the will with all the energies that flow therefrom. 
</p>

<p>
13. Not only can it impress other minds, but it can direct the subconscious
mind. In this way the conscious mind becomes the responsible ruler and guardian
of the subconscious mind. It is this high function which can completely reverse
conditions in your life. 
</p>

<p>
14. It is often true that conditions of fear, worry, poverty, disease, inharmony
and evils of all kinds dominate us by reason of false suggestions accepted by
the unguarded subconscious mind. All this the trained conscious mind can
entirely prevent by its vigilant protective action. It may properly be called
"the watchman at the gate" of the great subconscious domain. 
</p>

<p>
15. One writer has expressed the chief distinction between the two phases of
mind thus: "Conscious mind is reasoning will. Subconscious mind is instinctive
desire, the result of past reasoning will." 
</p>

<p>
16. The subconscious mind draws just and accurate inferences from premises
furnished from outside sources. Where the premise is true, the subconscious mind
reaches a faultless conclusion, but, where the premise or suggestion is an
error, the whole structure falls. The subconscious mind does not engage in the
process of proving. It relies upon the conscious mind, "the watchman at the
gate," to guard it from mistaken impressions. 
</p>

<p>
17. Receiving any suggestions as true, the subconscious mind at once proceeds to
act thereon in the whole domain of its tremendous field of work. The conscious
mind can suggest either truth or error. If the latter, it is at the cost of
wide-reaching peril to the whole being. 
</p>

<p>
18. The conscious mind ought to be on duty during every waking hour. When the
"watchman" is "off guard," or when its calm judgment is suspended, under a
variety of circumstances, then the subconscious mind is unguarded and left open
to suggestion from all sources. During the wild excitement of panic, or during
the height of anger, or the impulses of the irresponsible mob, or at any other
time of unrestrained passion, the conditions are most dangerous. The sub-
conscious mind is then open to the suggestion of fear, hatred, selfishness,
greed, self- depreciation and other negative forces, derived from surrounding
persons or circumstances. The result is usually unwholesome in the extreme, with
effects that may endure to distress it for a long time. Hence, the great
importance of guarding the subconscious mind from false impressions. 
</p>

<p>
19. The subconscious mind perceives by intuition. Hence, its processes are
rapid. It does not wait for the slow methods of conscious reasoning. In fact, it
can not employ them. 
</p>

<p>
20. The subconscious mind never sleeps, never rests, any more than does your
heart, or your blood. It has been found that by plainly stating to the
subconscious mind certain specific things to be accomplished, forces are set in
operation that lead to the result desired. Here, then, is a source of power
which places us in touch with Omnipotence. Here in is a deep principle which is
well worth our most earnest study. 
</p>

<p>
21. The operation of this law is interesting. Those who put it into operation
find that when they go out to meet the person with whom they anticipate a
difficult interview, something has been there before them and dissolved the
supposed differences; everything is changed; all is harmonious; they find that
when some difficult business problem presents itself they can afford to make
delay and something suggests the proper solution; everything is properly
arranged; in fact, those who have learned to trust the subconscious find that
they have infinite resources at their command. 
</p>

<p>
22. The subconscious mind is the seat of our principles and our aspirations. It
is the fount of our artistic and altruistic ideals. These instincts can only be
overthrown by an elaborate and gradual process of undermining the innate
principles. 
</p>

<p>
23. The subconscious mind can not argue controversially. Hence, if it has
accepted wrong suggestions, the sure method of overcoming them is by the use of
a strong counter suggestion, frequently repeated, which the mind must accept,
thus eventually forming new and healthy habits of thought and life, for the
subconscious mind is the seat of Habit. That which we do over and over becomes
mechanical; it is no longer an act of judgment, but has worn its deep grooves in
the subconscious mind. This is favorable for us if the habit be wholesome and
right. If it be harmful, and wrong, the remedy is to recognize the omnipotence
of the subconscious mind and suggest present actual freedom. The subconscious
being creative and one with our divine source will at once create the freedom
suggested. 
</p>

<p>
24. To sum up: The normal functions of the subconscious on the physical side
have to do with the regular and vital processes, with the preservation of life
and the restoration of health; with the care of offspring, which includes an
instinctive desire to preserve all life and improve conditions generally. 
</p>

<p>
25. On the mental side, it is the storehouse of memory; it harbors the wonderful
thought messengers, who work, unhampered by time or space; it is the fountain of
the practical initiative and constructive forces of life: It is the seat of
habit. 
</p>

<p>
26. On the spiritual side, it is the source of ideals, of aspiration, of the
imagination, and is the channel through which we recognize our Divine Source,
and in proportion as we recognize this divinity do we come into an understanding
of the source of power. 
</p>

<p>
27. Some one may ask: "How can the subconscious change conditions?" The reply
is, because the subconscious is a part of the Universal Mind and a part must be
the same in kind and quality as the whole; the only difference is one of degree.
The whole, as we know, is creative, in fact, it is the only creator there is,
consequently, we find that mind is creative, and as thought is the only activity
which the mind possesses thought must necessarily be creative also. 
</p>

<p>
28. But we shall find that there is a vast difference between simply thinking,
and directing our thought consciously, systematically and constructively; when
we do this we place our mind in harmony with the Universal Mind, we come in tune
with the Infinite, we set in operation the mightiest force in existence, the
creative power of the Universal Mind. This, as everything else, is governed by
natural law, and this law is the "Law of attraction," which is that Mind is
creative, and will automatically correlate with its object and bring it into
manifestation. 
</p>

<p>
29. Last week I gave you an exercise for the purpose of securing control of the
physical body; if you have accomplished this you are ready to advance. This time
you will begin to control your thought. Always take the same room, the same
chair, and the same position, if possible. In some cases it is not convenient to
take the same room, in this case simply make the best use of such conditions as
may be available. Now be perfectly still as before, but inhibit all thought;
this will give you control over all thoughts of care, worry and fear, and will
enable you to entertain only the kind of thoughts you desire. Continue this
exercise until you gain complete mastery. 
</p>

<p>
30. You will not be able to do this for more that a few moments at a time, but
the exercise is valuable, because it will be a very practical demonstration of
the great number of thoughts which are constantly trying to gain access to your
mental world. 
</p>

<p>
31. Next week you will receive instructions for an exercise which may be a
little more interesting, but it is necessary that you master this one first. 
</p>

<p>
"Cause and effect is as absolute and undeviating in the hidden realm of thought
as in the world of visible and material things. Mind is the master weaver, both
of the interior garment of character and the outer garment of circumstance." --
