<h1>INTRODUCTION - PART FIVE </h1>

<p>
Enclosed herewith you will find Part Five. After studying this part carefully,
you will see that every conceivable force or object or fact is the result of
mind in action.
</p>

<p>
Mind in action is thought, and thought is creative. Men are thinking now as they
never thought before. Therefore, this is a creative age, and the world is
awarding its richest prizes to the thinkers. 
</p>

<p>
Matter is powerless, passive, inert. Mind is force, energy, power. Mind shapes
and controls matter. Every form which matter takes is but the expression of some
pre-existing thought.
</p>

<p>
But thought works no magic transformations; it obeys natural laws; it sets in
motion natural forces; it releases natural energies; it manifests in your
conduct and actions, and these in turn react upon your friends and
acquaintances, and eventually upon the whole of your environment. 
</p>

<p>
You can originate thought, and, since thoughts are creative, you can create for
yourself the things you desire.
</p>

<h1>PART FIVE </h1>

<p>
1. At least ninety per cent of our mental life is subconscious, so that those
who fail to make use of this mental power live within very narrow limits. 
</p>

<p>
2. The subconscious can and will solve any problem for us if we know how to
direct it. The subconscious processes are always at work; the only question is,
are we to be simply passive recipients of this activity, or are we to
consciously direct the work? Shall we have a vision of the destination to be
reached, the dangers to be avoided, or shall we simply drift? 
</p>

<p>
3. We have found that mind pervades every part of the physical body and is
always capable of being directed or impressed by authority coming from the
objective or the more dominant portion of the mind. 
</p>

<p>
4. The mind, which pervades the body, is largely the result of heredity, which,
in turn, is simply the result of all the environments of all past generations on
the responsive and ever-moving life forces. An understanding of this fact will
enable us to use our authority when we find some undesirable trait of character
manifesting.
</p>

<p>
5. We can consciously use all the desirable characteristics with which we have
been provided and we can repress and refuse to allow the undesirable ones to
manifest. 
</p>

<p>
6. Again, this mind which pervades our physical body is not only the result of
hereditary tendencies, but is the result of home, business and social
environment, where countless thousands of impressions, ideas, prejudices and
similar thoughts have been received. Much of this has been received from others,
the result of opinions, suggestions or statements; much of it is the result of
our own thinking, but nearly all of it has been accepted with little or no
examination or consideration. 
</p>

<p>
7. The idea seemed plausible, the conscious received it, passed it on to the
subconscious, where it was taken up by the Sympathetic System and passed on to
be built into our physical body. "The word has become flesh." 
</p>

<p>
8. This, then, is the way we are consistently creating and recreating ourselves;
we are today the result of our past thinking, and we shall be what we are
thinking today, the Law of Attraction is bringing to us, not the things we
should like, or the things we wish for, or the things some one else has, but it
brings us "our own," the things which we have created by our thought processes,
whether consciously or unconsciously. Unfortunately, many of us are creating
these things unconsciously. 
</p>

<p>
9. If either of us were building a home for ourselves, how careful we would be
in regard to the plans; how we should study every detail; how we should watch
the material and select only the best of everything; and yet how careless we are
when it comes to building our Mental Home, which is infinitely more important
than any physical home, as everything which can possibly enter into our lives
depends upon the character of the material which enters into the construction of
our Mental Home. 
</p>

<p>
10. What is the character of this material? We have seen that it is the result
of the impressions which we have accumulated in the past and stored away in our
subconscious Mentality. If these impressions have been of fear, of worry, of
care, of anxiety; if they have been despondent, negative, doubtful, then the
texture of the material which we are weaving today will be of the same negative
material. Instead of being of any value, it will be mildewed and rotten and will
bring us only more toil and care and anxiety. We shall be forever busy trying to
patch it up and make it appear at least genteel.
</p>

<p>
11. But if we have stored away nothing but courageous thought, if we have been
optimistic, positive, and have immediately thrown any kind of negative thought
on the scrap pile, have refused to have anything to do with it, have refused to
associate with it or become identified with it in any way, what then is the
result? Our mental material is now of the best kind; we can weave any kind of
material we want; we can use any color we wish; we know that the texture is
firm, that the material is solid, that it will not fade, and we have no fear, no
anxiety concerning the future; there is nothing to cover, there are no patches
to hide. 
</p>

<p>
12. These are psychological facts; there is no theory or guess work about these
thinking processes; there is nothing secret about them; in fact, they are so
plain that every one can understand them. The thing to do is to have a mental
house-cleaning, and to have this house-cleaning every day, and keep the house
clean. Mental, moral and physical cleanliness are absolutely indispensable if we
are to make progress of any kind.
</p>

<p>
13. When this mental house-cleaning process has been completed, the material
which is left will be suitable for the making of the kind of ideals or mental
images which we desire to realize. 
</p>

<p>
14. There is a fine estate awaiting a claimant. Its broad acres, with abundant
crops, running water and fine timber, stretch away as far as the eye can see.
There is a mansion, spacious and cheerful, with rare pictures, a well-stocked
library, rich hangings, and every comfort and luxury. All the heir has to do is
to assert his heirship, take possession, and use the property. He must use it;
he must not let it decay; for use is the condition on which he holds it. To
neglect it is to lose possession. 
</p>

<p>
15. In the domain of mind and spirit, in the domain of practical power, such an
estate is yours. You are the heir! You can assert your heirship and possess, and
use this rich inheritance. Power over circumstances is one of its fruits,
health, harmony and prosperity are assets upon its balance sheet. It offers you
poise and peace. It costs you only the labor of studying and harvesting its
great resources. It demands no sacrifice, except the loss of your limitations,
your servitudes, your weakness. It clothes you with self-honor, and puts a
scepter in your hands.
</p>

<p>
16. To gain this estate, three processes are necessary: You must earnestly
desire it. You must assert your claim. You must take possession. 
</p>

<p>
17. You admit that those are not burdensome conditions. 
</p>

<p>
18. You are familiar with the subject of heredity. Darwin, Huxley, Haeckel, and
other physical scientists have piled evidence mountain high that heredity is a
law attending progressive creation. It is progressive heredity which gives man
his erect attitude, his power of motion, the organs of digestions, blood
circulation, nerve force, muscular force, bone structure and a host of other
faculties on the physical side. There are even more impressive facts concerning
heredity of mind force. All these constitute what may be called your human
heredity. 
</p>

<p>
19. But there is a heredity which the physical scientists have not compassed. It
lies beneath and antecedent to all their researches. At a point where they throw
up their hands in despair, saying they cannot account for what they see, this
divine heredity is found in full sway. 20. It is the benignant force which
decrees primal creation. It thrills down from the Divine, direct into every
created being. It originates life, which the physical scientist has not done,
nor ever can do. It stands out among all forces supreme, unapproachable. No
human heredity can approach it. No human heredity measures up to it. 
</p>

<p>
21. This Infinite Life flows through you; is you. Its doorways are but the
faculties which comprise your consciousness. To keep open these doors is the
Secret of Power. Is it not worth while to make the effort? 
</p>

<p>
22. The great fact is, that the source of all life and all power is from within.
Persons, circumstances and events may suggest need and opportunities, but the
insight, strength and power to answer these needs will be found within.
</p>

<p>
23. Avoid counterfeits. Build firm foundations for your consciousness upon
forces which flow direct from the Infinite source, the Universal Mind of which
you are the image and likeness. 
</p>

<p>
24. Those we have come into possession of this inheritance are never quite the
same again. They have come into possession of a sense of power hitherto
undreamed of. They can never again be timid, weak, vacillating, or fearful. They
are indissolubly connected with Omnipotence. Something in them has been aroused;
they have suddenly discovered that they possess a tremendous latent ability of
which they were heretofore entirely unconscious.
</p>

<p>
25. This power is from within, but we cannot receive it unless we give it. Use
is the condition upon which we hold this inheritance. We are each of us but the
channel through which the Omnipotent power is being differentiated into form;
unless we give, the channel is obstructed and we can receive no more. This is
true on every plane of existence and in every field of endeavor and all walks of
life. The more we give, the more we get. The athlete who wishes to get strong
must make use of the strength he has, and the more he gives the more he will
get. The financier who wishes to make money must make use of the money he has,
for only by using it can he get more. 
</p>

<p>
26. The merchant who does not keep his goods going out will soon have none
coming in; the corporation which fails to give efficient service will soon lack
customers; the attorney who fails to get results will soon lack clients, and so
it goes everywhere; power is contingent upon a proper use of the power already
in our possession; what is true in every field of endeavor, every experience in
life, is true of the power from which every other power known among men is
begotten -- spiritual power. Take away the spirit and what is left? Nothing.
</p>

<p>
27. If then the spirit is all there is, upon the recognition of this fact must
depend the ability to demonstrate all power, whether physical, mental or
spiritual. 
</p>

<p>
28. All possession is the result of the accumulative attitude of mind, or the
money consciousness; this is the magic wand which will enable you to receive the
idea, and it will formulate plans for you to execute, and you will find as much
pleasure in the execution as in the satisfaction of attainment and achievement. 
</p>

<p>
29. Now, go to your room, take the same seat, the same position as heretofore,
and mentally select a place which has pleasant associations. Make a complete
mental picture of it, see the buildings, the grounds, the trees, friends,
associations, everything complete. At first, you will find yourself thinking of
everything under the sun, except the ideal upon which you desire to concentrate.
But do not let that discourage you. Persistence will win, but persistence
requires that you practice these exercises every day without fail.
