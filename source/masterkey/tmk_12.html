<h1>INTRODUCTION - PART TWELVE</h1>

<p>
Part Twelve is enclosed herewith. In the fourth paragraph you will find the
following statement: "You must first have the knowledge of your power; second,
the courage to dare; third, the faith to do."
</p>

<p>
If you concentrate upon the thoughts given, if you give them your entire
attention, you will find a world of meaning in each sentence, and will attract
to yourself other thoughts in harmony with them, and you will soon grasp the
full significance of the vital knowledge upon which you are concentrating. 
</p>

<p>
Knowledge does not apply itself; we as individuals must make the application,
and the application consists in fertilizing the thought with a living purpose. 
</p>

<p>
The time and thought which most persons waste in aimless effort would accomplish
wonders if properly directed with some special object in view. In order to do
this, it is necessary to center your mental force upon a specific thought and
hold it there, to the exclusion of all other thoughts. If you have ever looked
through the viewfinder on a videocamera, you found that when the object was not
in focus, the impression was indistinct and possibly blurred, but when the
proper focus was obtained the picture was clear and distinct. This illustrates
the power of concentration. Unless you can concentrate upon the object which you
have in view, you will have but a hazy, indifferent, vague, indistinct and
blurred outline of your ideal and the results will be in accordance with your
mental picture. 
</p>

<h1>PART TWELVE</h1>

<p>
1. There is no purpose in life that cannot be best accomplished through a
scientific understanding of the creative power of thought. 
</p>

<p>
2. This power to think is common to all. Man is, because he thinks. Man's power
to think is infinite, consequently his creative power is unlimited. 
</p>

<p>
3. We know that thought is building for us the thing we think of and actually
bringing it nearer, yet we find it difficult to banish fear, anxiety or
discouragement, all of which are powerful thought forces, and which continually
send the things we desire further away, so that it is often one step forward and
two steps backward.
</p>

<p>
4. The only way to keep from going backward is to keep going forward. Eternal
vigilance is the price of success. There are three steps, and each one is
absolutely essential. You must first have the knowledge of your power; second,
the courage to dare; third, the faith to do. 
</p>

<p>
5. With this as a basis you can construct an ideal business, an ideal home,
ideal friends, and an ideal environment. You are not restricted as to material
or cost. Thought is omnipotent and has the power to draw on the Infinite bank of
primary substance for all that it requires. Infinite resources are therefore at
your command. 
</p>

<p>
6. But your ideal must be sharp, clear-cut, definite; to have one ideal today,
another tomorrow, and a third next week, means to scatter your forces and
accomplish nothing; your result will be a meaningless and chaotic combination of
wasted material. 
</p>

<p>
7. Unfortunately this is the result which many are securing, and the cause is
self evident. If a sculptor started out with a piece of marble and a chisel and
changed his ideal every fifteen minutes, what result could he expect? And why
should you expect any different result in molding the greatest and most plastic
of all substances, the only real substance? 
</p>

<p>
8. The result of this indecision and negative thought is often found in the loss
of material wealth. Supposed independence which required many years of toil and
effort suddenly disappears. It is often found then that money and property are
not independence at all. On the contrary, the only independence is found to be a
practical working knowledge of the creative power of thought. 
</p>

<p>
9. This practical working method cannot come to you until you learn that the
only real power which you can have is the power to adjust yourself to Divine and
unchangeable principles. You cannot change the Infinite, but you can come into
an understanding of Natural laws. The reward of this understanding is a
conscious realization of your ability to adjust your thought faculties with the
Universal Thought which is Omnipresent. Your ability to cooperate with this
Omnipotence will indicate the degree of success with which you meet. 
</p>

<p>
10. The power of thought has many counterfeits which are more or less
fascinating, but the results are harmful instead of helpful. 
</p>

<p>
11. Of course, worry, fear, and all negative thoughts produce a crop after their
kind; those who harbor thoughts of this kind must inevitably reap what they have
sown. 
</p>

<p>
12. Again, there are the Phenomena seekers who gormandize on the so-called
proofs and demonstration obtained at materializing seances. They throw open
their mental doors and soak themselves in the most poisonous currents which can
be found in the psychic world. They do not seem to understand that it is the
ability to become negative, receptive and passive, and thus drain themselves of
all their vital force, which enables them to bring about these vibratory thought
forms.
</p>

<p>
13. There are also the Hindu worshippers, who see in the materializing phenomena
which are performed by the so-called adepts, a source of power, forgetting, or
never seeming to realize that as soon as the will is withdrawn the forms wither,
and the vibratory forces of which they are composed vanish. 
</p>

<p>
14. Telepathy, or thought transference, has received considerable attention, but
as it requires a negative mental state on the part of the receiver, the practice
is harmful. A thought may be sent with the intention of hearing or seeing, but
it will bring the penalty attached to the inversion of the principle involved. 
</p>

<p>
15. In many instances, hypnotism is positively dangerous to the subject as well
as the operator. No one familiar with the laws governing in the mental world
would think of attempting to dominate the will of another, for by so doing, he
will gradually (but surely) divest himself of his own power. 
</p>

<p>
16. All of these perversions have their temporary satisfaction and for some a
keen fascination, but there is an infinitely greater fascination in a true
understanding of the world of power within, a power which increases with use; is
permanent instead of fleeing; which not only is potent as a remedial agency to
bring about the remedy for past error or results of wrong thinking, but is a
prophylactic agency protecting us from all manner and form of danger, and
finally is an actual creative force with which we can build new conditions and
new environment.
</p>

<p>
17. The law is that thought will correlate with its object and bring forth in
the material world the correspondence of the thing thought or produced in the
mental world. We then discern the absolute necessity of seeing that every
thought has the inherent germ of truth in order that the law of growth will
bring into manifestation good, for good alone can confer any permanent power. 
</p>

<p>
18. The principle which gives the thought the dynamic power to correlate with
its object, and therefore to master every adverse human experience, is the law
of attraction, which is another name for love. This is an eternal and
fundamental principle, inherent in all things, in every system of Philosophy, in
every Religion, and in every Science. There is no getting away from the law of
love. It is feeling that imparts vitality to thought. Feeling is desire, and
desire is love. Thought impregnated with love becomes invincible. 
</p>

<p>
19. We find this truth emphasized wherever the power of thought is understood,
The Universal Mind is not only Intelligence, but it is substance, and this
substance is the attractive force which brings electrons together by the law of
attraction so that they form atoms; the atoms in turn are brought together by
the same law and form molecules; molecules take objective forms; and so we find
that the law of love is the creative force behind every manifestation, not only
of atoms, but of worlds, of the Universe, of everything of which the imagination
can form any conception.
</p>

<p>
20. It is the operation of this marvelous law of attraction which has caused men
in all ages and all times to believe that there must be some personal being who
responded to their petitions and desires, and manipulated events in order to
comply with their requirements.
</p>

<p>
21. It is the combination of Thought and Love which forms the irresistible
force, called the law of attraction. All natural laws are irresistible, the law
of Gravitation, or Electricity, or any other law operates with mathematical
exactitude. There is no variation, it is only the channel of distribution which
may be imperfect. If a bridge falls, we do not attribute the collapse to any
variation of the law of gravitation. If a light fails us, we do not conclude
that the laws governing electricity cannot be depended upon, and if the law of
attraction seems to be imperfectly demonstrated by an inexperienced or
uninformed person, we are not to conclude that the greatest and most infallible
law upon which the entire system of creation depends has been suspended. We
should rather conclude that a little more understanding of the law is required,
for the same reason that a correct solution of a difficult problem in
Mathematics is not always readily and easily obtained. 
</p>

<p>
22. Things are created in the mental or spiritual world be fore they appear in
the outward act or event. by the simple process of governing our thought forces
today, we help create the events which will come into our lives in the future,
perhaps even tomorrow. Educated desire is the most potent means of bringing into
action the law of attraction.
</p>

<p>
23. Man is so constituted that he must first create the tools, or implements by
which he gains the power to think. The mind cannot comprehend an entirely new
idea until a corresponding vibratory brain cell has been prepared to receive it.
This explains why it is so difficult for us to receive or appreciate an entirely
new idea; we have no brain cell capable of receiving it; we are therefore
incredulous; we do not believe it. 
</p>

<p>
24. If, therefore, you have not been familiar with the Omnipotence of the law of
attraction, and the scientific method by which it can be put into operation, or
if you have not been familiar with the unlimited possibilities which it opens to
those who are enabled to take advantage of the resources it offers, begin now
and create the necessary brain cells which will enable you to comprehend the
unlimited powers which may be yours by cooperating with Natural Law. This is
done by concentration or attention. 
</p>

<p>
25. The intention governs the attention. Power comes through repose. It is by
concentration that deep thoughts, wise speech, and all forces of high
potentiality are accomplished. 
</p>

<p>
26. It is in the Silence that you get into touch with the Omnipotent power of
the subconscious mind from which all power is evolved. 
</p>

<p>
27. He who desires wisdom, power, or permanent success of any kind will find it
only within; it is an unfoldment. The unthinking may conclude that the silence
is very simple and easily attained, but it should be remembered that only in
absolute silence may one come into contact with Divinity itself; may learn of
the unchangeable law and open for himself the channels by which persistent
practice and concentration lead to perfection. 
</p>

<p>
28. This week go to the same room, take the same chair, the same position as
previously; be sure to relax, let go, both mentally and physically; always do
this; never try to do any mental work under pressure; see that there are no
tense muscles or nerves, that you are entirely comfortable. Now realize your
unity with omnipotence; get into touch with this power, come into a deep and
vital understanding, appreciation, and realization of the fact that your ability
to think is your ability to act upon the Universal Mind, and bring it into
manifestation, realize that it will meet any and every requirement; that you
have exactly the same potential ability which any individual ever did have or
ever will have, because each is but an expression or manifestation of the One,
all are parts of the whole, there is no difference in kind or quality, the only
difference being one of degree.

who first uttered it may be only the suggester, but the doer will appear." -
