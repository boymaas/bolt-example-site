<h1>INTRODUCTION - PART SIXTEEN </h1>

<p>
The vibratory activities of the planetary Universe are governed by a law of
periodicity. Everything that lives has periods of birth, growth, fruitage, and
decline. These periods are governed by the Septimal Law.
</p>

<p>
The Law of Sevens governs the days of the week, the phases of the moon, the
harmonies of sound, light, heat, electricity, magnetism, atomic structure. It
governs the life of individuals and of nations, and it dominates the activities
of the commercial world.
</p>

<p>
Life is growth, and growth is change, each seven years period takes us into a
new cycle. The first seven years is the period of infancy. The next seven the
period of childhood, representing the beginning of individual responsibility.
The next seven represents the period of adolescence. The fourth period marks the
attainment of full growth. The fifth period is the constructive period, when men
begin to acquire property, possessions, a home and family. The next from 35 to
42, is a period of reactions and changes, and this in turn is followed by a
period of reconstruction, adjustment and recuperation, so as to be ready for a
new cycle of sevens, beginning with the fiftieth year. 
</p>

<p>
There are many who think that the world is just bout to pass out of the sixth
period; that it will soon enter into the seventh period, the period of
readjustment, reconstruction and harmony; the period which is frequently
referred to as the Millennium.
</p>

<p>
Those familiar with these cycles will not be disturbed when things seem to go
wrong, but can apply the principle outlined in these lessons with the full
assurance that a higher law will invariably control all other laws, and that
through an understanding and conscious operation of spiritual laws, we can
convert every seeming difficulty into a blessing. 
</p>

<p>
<h1>PART SIXTEEN </h1>
1. Wealth is a product of labor. Capital is an effect, not a cause; a servant,
not a master; a means, not an end. 
</p>

<p>
2. The most commonly accepted definition of wealth is that it consists of all
useful and agreeable things which possess exchange value. It is this exchange
value which is the predominant characteristic of wealth. 
</p>

<p>
3. When we consider the small addition made by wealth to the happiness of the
possessor, we find that the true value consists not in its utility but in its
exchange. 
</p>

<p>
4. This exchange value makes it a medium for securing the things of real value
whereby our ideals may be realized.
</p>

<p>
5. Wealth should then never be desired as an end, but simply as a means of
accomplishing an end. Success is contingent upon a higher ideal than the mere
accumulation of riches, and he who aspires to such success must formulate an
ideal for which he is willing to strive.
</p>

<p>
6. With such an ideal in mind, the ways and means can and will be provided, but
the mistake must not be made of substituting the means for the end. There must
be a definite fixed purpose, an ideal. 
</p>

<p>
7. Prentice Mulford said: "The man of success is the man possessed of the
greatest spiritual understanding and every great fortune comes of superior and
truly spiritual power." Unfortunately, there are those who fail to recognize
this power; they forget that Andrew Carnegie's mother had to help support the
family when they came to America, that Harriman's father was a poor clergyman
with a salary of only $200.00 a year, that Sir Thomas Lipton started with only
25 cents. These men had no other power to depend upon, but it did not fail them.
</p>

<p>
8. The power to create depends entirely upon spiritual power; there are three
steps, idealization, visualization and materialization. Every captain of
industry depends upon this power exclusively. In an article in Everybody's
Magazine, Henry M. Flagler, the Standard Oil multi-millionaire, admitted that
the secret of his success was his power to see a thing in its completeness. The
following conversation with the reporter shows his power of idealization,
concentration and visualization, all spiritual powers:
</p>

<p>
9. "Did you actually vision to yourself the whole thing? I mean, did you, or
could you, really close your eyes and see the tracks? And the trains running?
and hear the whistles blowing: Did you go as far as that?" "Yes." "How clearly?"
"Very clearly." 
</p>

<p>
10. Here we have a vision of the law, we see "cause and effect", we see that
thought necessarily precedes and determines action. If we are wise, we shall
come into a realization of the tremendous fact that no arbitrary condition can
exist for a moment, and that human experience is the result of an orderly and
harmonious sequence. 
</p>

<p>
11. The successful business man is more often than not an idealist and is every
striving for higher and higher standards. The subtle forces of thought as they
crystallize in our daily moods is what constitutes life. 
</p>

<p>
12. Thought is the plastic material with which we build images of our growing
conception of life. Use determines its existence. As in all other things our
ability to recognize it and use it properly is the necessary condition for
attainment. 
</p>

<p>
13. Premature wealth is but the forerunner of humiliation and disaster, because
we cannot permanently retain anything which we do not merit or which we have not
earned.
</p>

<p>
14. The conditions with which we meet in the world without, correspond to the
conditions which we find in the world within. This is brought about by the law
of attraction. How then shall we determine what is to enter into the world
within? 
</p>

<p>
15. Whatever enters the mind through the senses or the objective mind will
impress the mind and result in a mental image which will become a pattern for
the creative energies. These experiences are largely the result of environment,
chance, past thinking and other forms of negative thought, and must be subjected
to careful analysis before being entertained. On the other hand, we can form our
own mental images, through our own interior processes of thought regardless of
the thoughts of others, regardless of exterior conditions, regardless of
environment of every kind, and it is by the exercise of this power that we can
control our own destiny, body, mind and soul. 
</p>

<p>
16. It is by the exercise of this power that we take our fate out of the hands
of chance, and consciously make for ourselves the experiences which we desire,
because when we consciously realize a condition, that condition will eventually
manifest in our lives; it is therefore evident that in the last analysis
thinking is the one great cause in life. 
</p>

<p>
17. Therefore, to control thought is to control circumstances, conditions,
environment, and destiny. 
</p>

<p>
18. How then are we to control thought; what is the process? To think is to
create a thought, but the result of the thought will depend upon its form, its
quality and its vitality. 
</p>

<p>
19. The form will depend upon the mental images from which it emanates; this
will depend upon the depth of the impression, the predominance of the idea, the
clarity of the vision, the boldness of the image. 
</p>

<p>
20. The quality depends upon its substance, and this depends upon the material
of which the mind is composed; if this material has been woven from thoughts of
vigor, strength, courage, determination, the thought will possess these
qualities. 
</p>

<p>
21. And finally, the vitality depends upon the feeling with which the thought is
impregnated. If the thought is constructive, it will possess vitality; it will
have life, it will grow, develop, expand, it will be creative; it will attract
to itself everything necessary for its complete development. 
</p>

<p>
22. If the thought is destructive, it will have within itself the germ of its
own dissolution; it will die, but in the process of dying, it will bring
sickness, disease, and every other form of discord.
</p>

<p>
23. This we call evil, and when we bring it upon ourselves, some of us are
disposed to attribute our difficulties to a Supreme Being, but this supreme
being is simply Mind in equilibrium. 
</p>

<p>
24. It is neither good nor bad, it simply is. 
</p>

<p>
25. Our ability to differentiate it into form is our ability to manifest good or
evil. 
</p>

<p>
26. Good and evil therefore are not entities, they are simply words which we use
to indicate the result of our actions, and these actions are in turn
predetermined by the character of our thought. 
</p>

<p>
27. If our thought is constructive and harmonious we manifest good; if it is
destructive and discordant we manifest evil. 
</p>

<p>
28. If you desire to visualize a different environment, the process is simply to
hold the ideal in mind, until your vision has been made real; give no thought to
persons, places or things; these have no place in the absolute; the environment
you desire will contain everything necessary; the right persons, and the right
things will come at the right time and in the right place.
</p>

<p>
29. It is sometimes not plain how character, ability, attainment, achievement,
environment and destiny can be controlled through the power of visualization,
but this is an exact scientific fact. 
</p>

<p>
30. You will readily see that what we think determines the quality of mind, and
that the quality of mind in turn determines our ability and mental capacity, and
you can readily understand that the improvement in our ability will naturally be
followed by increase in attainment and a greater control of circumstances.
</p>

<p>
31. It will thus be seen that Natural laws work in a perfectly natural and
harmonious manner; everything seems to "just happen." If you want any evidence
of this fact simply compare results of your efforts in your own life, when your
actions were prompted by high ideals and when you had selfish or ulterior
motives in mind. You will need no further evidence.
</p>

<p>
32. If you wish to bring about the realization of any desire, form a mental
picture of success in your mind, by consciously visualizing your desire; in this
way you will be compelling success, you will be externalizing it in your life by
scientific methods. 
</p>

<p>
33. We can only see what already exists in the objective world, but what we
visualize, already exists in the spiritual world, and this visualization is a
substantial token of what will one day appear in the objective world, if we are
faithful to our ideal. The reason for this is not difficult; visualization is a
form of imagination; this process of thinking forms impressions on the mind, and
these impressions in turn form concepts and ideals, and they in turn are the
plans from which the Master architect will weave the future.
</p>

<p>
34. The psychologists have come to the conclusion that there is but one sense,
the sense of feeling, and that all other senses are but modifications of this
one sense; this being true, we know why feeling is the very fountain head of
power, why the emotions so easily overcome the intellect, and why we must put
feeling into our thought, if we wish results. Thought and feeling is the
irresistible combination.
</p>

<p>
35. Visualization must, of course, be directed by the will; we are to visualize
exactly what we want; we must be careful not to let the imagination run riot.
Imagination is a good servant but a poor master, and unless it is controlled it
may easily lead us into all kinds of speculations and conclusions which have no
basis or foundation of fact whatever. Every kind of plausible opinion is liable
to be accepted without any analytical examination and the inevitable result is
mental chaos. 
</p>

<p>
36. We must therefore construct only such mental images as are known to be
scientifically true. Subject every idea to a searching analysis and accept
nothing which is not scientifically exact. When you do this you will attempt
nothing but what you know you can carry out and success will crown your efforts;
this is what businessmen call far-sightedness; it is much the same as insight,
and is one of the great secrets of success in all important undertakings. 
</p>

<p>
37. For your exercise this week, try to bring yourself to a realization of the
important fact that harmony and happiness are states of consciousness and do not
depend upon the possession of things. That things are effects and come as a
consequence of correct mental states. So that if we desire material possession
of any kind our chief concern should be to acquire the mental attitude which
will bring about the result desired. This mental attitude is brought about by a
realization of our spiritual nature and our unity with the Universal Mind which
is the substance of all things. This realization will bring about everything
which is necessary for our complete enjoyment. This is scientific or correct
thinking. When we succeed in bringing about this mental attitude it is
comparatively easy to realize our desire as an already accomplished fact; when
we can do this we shall have found the "Truth" which makes us "free" from every
lack or limitation of any kind.
