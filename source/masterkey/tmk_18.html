<h1>INTRODUCTION - PART EIGHTEEN</h1>

<p>
In order to grow we must obtain what is necessary for our growth. This is
brought about through the law of attraction. This principle is the sole means by
which the individual is differentiated from the Universal.
</p>

<p>
Think for a moment, what would a man be if he were not a husband, father, or
brother, if he were not interested in the social, economical, political or
religious world. He would be nothing but an abstract theoretical ego. He exists,
therefore, only in his relation to the whole, in his relation to other men, in
his relation to society. This relation constitutes his environment and in no
other way. 
</p>

<p>
It is evident, therefore, that the individual is simply the differentiation of
the one Universal Mind "which lighteth every man that cometh into the world,"
and his so-called individuality or personality consists of nothing but the
manner in which he relates with the whole.
</p>

<p>
This we call his environment and is brought about by the law of attraction. Part
Eighteen, which follows, has something more to say concerning this important
law.
</p>

<p>
<h1>PART EIGHTEEN </h1>
</p>

<p>
1. There is a change in the thought of the world. This change is silently
transpiring in our midst, and is more important than any which the world has
undergone since the downfall of Paganism.
</p>

<p>
2. These present revolution in the opinions of all classes of men, the highest
and most cultured of men as well as those of the laboring class, stands
unparalleled in the history of the world.
</p>

<p>
3. Science has of late made such vast discoveries, has revealed such an infinity
of resources, has unveiled such enormous possibilities and such unsuspected
forces, that scientific men more and more hesitate to affirm certain theories as
established and beyond doubt or to deny other theories as absurd or impossible. 
</p>

<p>
4. A new civilization is being born; customs, creeds, and precedent are passing;
vision, faith and service are taking their place. The fetters of tradition are
being melted off from humanity, and as the impurities of materialism are being
consumed, thought is being liberated and truth is rising full robed before an
astonished multitude. 
</p>

<p>
5. The whole world is on the eve of a new consciousness, a new power, and a new
realization within the self. 
</p>

<p>
6. Physical Science has resolved matter into molecules, molecules into atoms,
atoms into energy, and it has remained for Mr. J. A. Fleming, in an address
before the Royal Institution, to resolve this energy into mind. He says, "In its
ultimate essence, energy may be incomprehensible by us except as an exhibition
of the direct operation of that which we call Mind or Will." 
</p>

<p>
7. And this mind is the indwelling and ultimate. It is imminent in matter as in
spirit. It is the sustaining, energizing, all pervading Spirit of the universe. 
</p>

<p>
8. Every living thing must be sustained by this omnipotent Intelligence, and we
find the difference in individual lives to be largely measured by the degree of
this intelligence, which they manifest. It is greater intelligence that places
the animal in a higher scale of being than the plant, the man higher than the
animal, and we find that this increased intelligence is again indicated by the
power of the individual to control modes of action and thus to consciously
adjust himself to his environment. 
</p>

<p>
9. It is this adjustment that occupies the attention of the greatest minds, and
this adjustment consists in nothing else than the recognition of an existing
order in the universal mind, for it is well known that this mind will obey us
precisely in proportion as we first obey it. 
</p>

<p>
10. It is the recognition of Natural Laws that has enabled us to annihilate time
and space, to soar in the air and to make iron float, and the greater the degree
of intelligence the greater will be our recognition of these Natural Laws and
the greater will be the power we can possess. 
</p>

<p>
11. It is the recognition of the self as an individualization of this Universal
Intelligence that enables the individual to control those forms of intelligence
which have not yet reached this level of self-recognition; they do not know that
this Universal Intelligence permeates all things ready to be called into action;
they do not know that it is responsive to every demand, and they are therefore
in bondage to the law of their own being. 
</p>

<p>
12. Thought is creative and the principle on which the law is based is sound and
legitimate and is inherent in the nature of things; but this creative power does
not originate in the individual, but in the universal, which is the source and
foundation of all energy and substance; the individual is simply the channel for
the distribution of this energy. 
</p>

<p>
13. The individual is simply the means by which the universal produces the
various combinations which result in the formation of phenomena, which depends
upon the law of vibration, whereby various rates of rapidity of motion in the
primary substance form new substances only in certain exact numerical ratios. 
</p>

<p>
14. Thought is the invisible link by which the individual comes into
communication with the Universal, the finite with the Infinite, the seen with
the Unseen. Thought is the magic by which the human is transformed into a being
who thinks and knows and feels and acts.
</p>

<p>
15. As the proper apparatus has enabled the eye to discover worlds without
number millions of miles away, so, with the proper understanding, man has been
enabled to communicate with the Universal Mind, the source of all power. 
</p>

<p>
16. The Understanding which is usually developed is about as valuable as a VCR
without a videotape; in fact, it is usually nothing more than a "belief", which
means nothing at all. The savages of the Cannibal Islands believe something; but
that proves nothing. 
</p>

<p>
17. The only belief which is of any value to anyone is a belief that has been
put to a test and demonstrated to be a fact; it is then no longer a belief, but
has become a living Faith or Truth. 
</p>

<p>
18. And this Truth has been put to the test by hundreds of thousands of people
and has been found to be the Truth exactly in proportion to the usefulness of
the apparatus which they used. 
</p>

<p>
19. A man would not expect to locate stars hundreds of millions of miles away
without a sufficiently strong telescope, and for this reason Science is
continually engaged in building larger and more powerful telescopes and is
continually rewarded by additional knowledge of the heavenly bodies.
</p>

<p>
20. So with understanding; men are continually making progress in the methods
which they use to come into communication with the Universal Mind and its
infinite possibilities.
</p>

<p>
21. The Universal Mind manifests itself in the objective, through the principle
of attraction that each atom has for every other atom, in infinite degrees of
intensity. 
</p>

<p>
22. It is by this principle of combining and attracting that things are brought
together. This principle is of universal application and is the sole means
whereby the purpose of existence is carried into effect. 
</p>

<p>
23. The expression of growth is met in a most beautiful manner through the
instrumentality of this Universal Principle.
</p>

<p>
24. In order to grow we must obtain what is essential for our growth, but as we
are at all times a complete thought entity, this completeness makes it possible
for us to receive only as we give; growth is therefore conditioned on reciprocal
action, and we find that on the mental plane like attracts like, that mental
vibrations respond only to the extent of their vibratory harmony.
</p>

<p>
25. It is clear, therefore, that thoughts of abundance will respond only to
similar thoughts; the wealth of the individual is seen to be what he inherently
is. Affluence within is found to be the secret of attraction for affluence
without. The ability to produce is found to be the real source of wealth of the
individual. It is for this reason that he who has his heart in his work is
certain to meet with unbounded success. He will give and continually give; and
the more he gives, the more he will receive. 
</p>

<p>
26. What do the great financiers of Wall Street, the captains of industry, the
statesmen, the great corporation attorneys, the inventors, the physicians, the
authors -- what do each of these contribute to the sum of human happiness but
the power of their thought? 
</p>

<p>
27. Thought is the energy which the law of attraction is brought into operation,
which eventually manifests in abundance. 
</p>

<p>
28. The Universal Mind is static Mind or Substance in equilibrium. It is
differentiated into form by our power to think. Thought is the dynamic phase of
mind.
</p>

<p>
29. Power depends upon consciousness of power; unless we use it, we shall lose
it, and unless we are conscious of it, we cannot use it. 
</p>

<p>
30. The use of this power depends upon attention; the degree of attention
determines our capacity for the acquirement of knowledge which is another name
for power. 
</p>

<p>
31. Attention has been held to be the distinguishing mark of genius. The
cultivation of attention depends upon practice. 
</p>

<p>
32. The incentive of attention is interest; the greater the interest, the
greater the attention; the greater the attention, the greater the interest,
action and reaction; begin by paying attention; before long you will have
aroused interest; this interest will attract more attention, and this attention
will produce more interest, and so on. This practice will enable you to
cultivate the power of attention. 
</p>

<p>
33. This week concentrate upon your power to create; seek insight, perception;
try to find a logical basis for the faith which is in you. Let the thought dwell
on the fact that the physical man lives and moves and has his being in the
sustainer of all organic life air, that he must breathe to live. Then let the
thought rest on the fact that the spiritual man also lives and moves and has his
being in a similar but subtler energy upon which he must depend for life, and
that as in the physical world no life assumes form until after a seed is sown,
and no higher fruit than that of the parent stock can be produced; so in the
spiritual world no effect can be produced until the seed is sown and the fruit
will depend upon the nature of the seed, so that the results which you secure
depend upon your perception of law in the mighty domain of causation, the
highest evolution of human consciousness.

power and organizes a huge instrumentality of means." - Emerson
