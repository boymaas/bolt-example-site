<h1>INTRODUCTION - PART NINETEEN </h1>

<p>
Fear is a powerful form of thought. It paralyzes the nerve centers, thus
affecting the circulation of the blood. This, in turn, paralyzes the muscular
system, so that fear affects the entire being, body, brain and nerve, physical,
mental, and muscular.
</p>

<p>
Of course the way to overcome fear is to become conscious of power. What is this
mysterious vital force which we call power? We do not know, but then, neither do
we know what electricity is. But we do know that by conforming to the
requirements of the law by which electricity is governed, it will be our
obedient servant; that it will light our homes, our cities, run our machinery,
and serve us in many useful capacities. 
</p>

<p>
And so it is with vital force. Although we do not know what it is, and possibly
may never know, we do know that it is a primary force which manifests through
living bodies, and that by complying with the laws and principles by which it is
governed, we can open ourselves to a more abundant inflow of this vital energy,
and thus express the highest possible degree of mental, moral, and spiritual
efficiency.
</p>

<p>
This part tells of a very simply way of developing this vital force. If you put
into practice the information outlined in this lesson you will soon develop the
sense of power which has ever been the distinguishing mark of genius.

<p>
1. The search for truth is no longer a haphazard adventure, but it is a
systematic process, and is logical in its operation. Every kind of experience is
given a voice in shaping its decision. 
</p>

<p>
2. In seeking the truth we are seeking ultimate cause; we know that every human
experience is an effect; then if we may ascertain the cause, and if we shall
find that this cause is one which we can consciously control, the effect or the
experience will be within our control also. 
</p>

<p>
3. Human experience will then no longer be the football of fate; a man will not
be the child of fortune, but destiny. Fate and fortune will be controlled as
readily as a captain controls his ship, or an engineer his train.
</p>

<p>
4. All things are finally resolvable into the same element and as they are thus
translatable, one into the other, they must ever be in relation and may never be
in opposition to one another. 
</p>

<p>
5. In the physical world there are innumerable contrasts, and these may for
convenience sake, be designated by distinctive names. There are sizes, colors,
shades or ends to all things. There is a North Pole, and a South Pole, an inside
and an outside, a seen and an unseen, but these expressions merely serve to
place extremes in contrast. 
</p>

<p>
6. They are names given to two different parts of one quantity. The two extremes
are relative; they are not separate entities, but are two parts or aspects of
the whole.
</p>

<p>
7. In the mental world we find the same law; we speak of knowledge and
ignorance, but ignorance is but a lack of knowledge and is therefore found to be
simply a word to express the absence of knowledge; it has no principle in
itself. 
</p>

<p>
8. In the Moral World we again find the same law; we speak of good and evil, but
Good is a reality, something tangible, while Evil is found to be simply a
negative condition, the absence of Good. Evil is sometimes thought to be a very
real condition, but it has no principle, no vitality, no life; we know this
because it can always be destroyed by Good; just as Truth destroys Error and
light destroys darkness, so Evil vanishes when Good appears; there is therefore
but one principle in the Moral World. 
</p>

<p>
9. We find exactly the same law obtaining in the Spiritual world; we speak of
Mind and Matter as two separate entities, but clearer insight makes it evident
that there is but one operative principle and that is Mind. 
</p>

<p>
10. Mind is the real and the eternal. Matter is forever changing; we know that
in the eons of time a hundred years is but as a day. If we stand in any large
city and let the eye rest on the innumerable large and magnificent buildings,
the vast array of modern automobiles, cellular telephones, the electric lights,
and all the other conveniences of modern civilization, we may remember that not
one of them was there just over a century ago, and if we could stand on the same
spot in a hundred years from now, in all probability we should find that but few
of them remained.
</p>

<p>
11. In the animal kingdom we find the same law of change. The millions and
millions of animals come and go, a few years constituting their span of life. In
the plant world the change is still more rapid. Many plants and nearly all
grasses come and go in a single year. When we pass to the inorganic, we expect
to find something more substantial, but as we gaze on the apparently solid
continent, we are told that it arose from the ocean; we see the giant mountain
and are told that the place where it now stands was once a lake; and as we stand
in awe before the great cliffs in the Yosemite Valley we can easily trace the
path of the glaciers which carried all before them.
</p>

<p>
12. We are in the presence of continual change, and we know that this change is
but the evolution of the Universal Mind, the grand process whereby all things
are continually being created anew, and we come to know that matter is but a
form which Mind takes and is therefore simply a condition. Matter has no
principle; Mind is the only principle. 
</p>

<p>
13. We have then come to know that Mind is the only principle which is operative
in the physical, mental, moral and spiritual world. 
</p>

<p>
14. We also know that this mind is static, mind at rest, we also know that the
ability of the individual to think is his ability to act upon the Universal Mind
and convert it into dynamic mind, or mind in motion. 
</p>

<p>
15. In order to do this fuel must be applied in the form of food, for man cannot
think without eating, and so we find that even a spiritual activity such as
thinking cannot be converted into sources of pleasure and profit except by
making use of material means. 
</p>

<p>
16. It requires energy of some kind to collect electricity and convert it into a
dynamic power, it requires the rays of the sun to give the necessary energy to
sustain plant life, so it also requires energy in the form of food to enable the
individual to think and thereby act upon the Universal Mind. 
</p>

<p>
17. You may know that thought constantly, eternally is taking form, is forever
seeking expression, or you may not, but the fact remains that if your thought is
powerful, constructive, and positive, this will be plainly evident in the state
of your health, your business and your environment; if your thought is weak,
critical, destructive and negative generally, it will manifest in your body as
fear, worry and nervousness, in your finance as lack and limitation, and in
discordant conditions in your environment.
</p>

<p>
18. All wealth is the offspring of power; possessions are of value only as they
confer power. Events are significant only as they affect power; all things
represent certain forms and degrees of power. 
</p>

<p>
19. A knowledge of cause and effect as shown by the laws governing steam,
electricity, chemical affinity and gravitation enables men to plan courageously
and to execute fearlessly. These laws are called Natural Laws, because they
govern the physical world, but all power is not physical power; there is also
mental power, and there is moral and spiritual power.
</p>

<p>
20. What are our schools, our universities, but mental powerhouses, places where
mental power is being developed? 
</p>

<p>
21. As there are many mighty powerhouses for the application of power to
ponderous machinery, whereby raw material is collected and converted into the
necessities and comforts of life, so the mental powerhouses collect the raw
material and cultivate and develop it into a power which is infinitely superior
to all the forces of nature, marvelous though they may be. 
</p>

<p>
22. What is this raw material which is being collected in these thousands of
mental powerhouses all over the world and developed into a power which is
evidently controlling every other power? In its static form it is Mind - in its
dynamic form, it is Thought. 
</p>

<p>
23. This power is superior because it exists on a higher plane, because it has
enabled man to discover the law by which these wonderful forces of Nature could
be harnessed and made to do the work of hundreds and thousands of men. It has
enabled man to discover laws whereby time and space have been annihilated, and
the law of gravitation overcome.
</p>

<p>
24. Thought is the vital force or energy which is being developed and which has
produced such startling results in the last half century as to bring about a
world which would be absolutely inconceivable to a man existing only 50 or 25
years ago. If such results have been secured by organizing these mental
powerhouses in 50 years, what may not be expected in another 50 years? 
</p>

<p>
25. The substance from which all things are created is infinite in quantity; we
know that light travels at the rate of 186,000 miles per second, and we know
that there are stars so remote that it takes light 2,000 years to reach us, and
we know that such starts exist in all parts of the heaven; we know, too, that
this light comes in waves, so that if the ether on which these waves travel was
not continuous the light would fail to reach us; we can then only come to the
conclusion that this substance, or ether, or raw material, is universally
present.
</p>

<p>
26. How, then, does it manifest in form? In electrical science a battery is
formed by connecting the opposite poles of zinc and copper, which causes a
current to flow from one to the other and so provides energy. This same process
is repeated in respect to every polarity, and as all form simply depends upon
the rate of vibration and consequent relations of atoms to each other, if we
wish to change the form of manifestation we must change the polarity. This is
the principle of causation.
</p>

<p>
27. For your exercise this week, concentrate, and when I use the word
concentrate, I mean all that the word implies; become so absorbed in the object
of your thought that you are conscious of nothing else, and do this a few
minutes every day. You take the necessary time to eat in order that the body may
be nourished, why not take the time to assimilate your mental food? 
</p>

<p>
28. Let the thought rest on the fact that appearances are deceptive. The earth
is not flat, neither is it stationary; the sky is not a dome, the sun does not
move, the stars are not small specks of light, and matter which was once
supposed to be fixed has been found to be in a state of perpetual flux.
</p>

<p>
29. Try to realize that the day is fast approaching -- its dawn is now at hand
-- when modes of thought and action must be adjusted to rapidly increasing
knowledge of the operation of eternal principles.
</p>

<h1>PART NINETEEN Study Questions with Answers </h1>

<p>
181. How are extremes placed in contrast? They are designated by distinctive
names, such as inside and outside, top and bottom, light and dark, good and bad. 
</p>

<p>
182. Are these separate entities? No, they are parts or aspects of one Whole. 
</p>

<p>
183. What is the one creative Principle in the physical, mental and spiritual
world? The Universal Mind, or the Eternal Energy from which all things proceed. 
</p>

<p>
184. How are we related to this creative Principle? By our ability to think. 
</p>

<p>
185. How does this creative Principle become operative? Thought is the seed,
which results in action and action results in form. 
</p>

<p>
186. Upon what does form depend? Upon the rate of vibration. 
</p>

<p>
187. How may the rate of vibration be changed? By mental action. 
</p>

<p>
188. Upon what does mental action depend? Upon polarity, action and reaction,
between the individual and the Universal. 
</p>

<p>
189. Does the creative energy originate in the individual or the Universal? In
the Universal, but the Universal can manifest only through the individual.
</p>

<p>
190. Why is the individual necessary? Because the Universal is static, and
requires energy to start it in motion. This is furnished by food which is
converted into energy, which in turn enables the individual to think. When the
individual stops eating he stops thinking; then he no longer acts upon the
Universal; there is consequently no longer any action or reaction; the Universal
is then only pure mind in static form -- mind at rest.
