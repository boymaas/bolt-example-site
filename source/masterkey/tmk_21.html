<h1>INTRODUCTION - PART TWENTY-ONE </h1>

<p>
It is my privilege to enclose Part Twenty-One. In paragraph 7 you will find that
one of the secrets of success, one of the methods of organizing victory, one of
the accomplishments of the Master Mind is to think big thoughts.
</p>

<p>
In paragraph 8 you will find that everything which we hold in our consciousness
for any length of time becomes impressed upon our subconsciousness and so
becomes a pattern which the creative energy will wave into our life and
environment. This is the secret of the wonderful power of prayer. 
</p>

<p>
We know that the universe is governed by law; that for every effect there must
be a cause, and that the same cause, under the same conditions, will invariably
produce the same effect. Consequently, if prayer has ever been answered, it will
always be answered, if the proper conditions are complied with. This must
necessarily be true; otherwise the universe would be a chaos instead of a
cosmos. The answer to prayer is therefore subject to law, and this law is
definite, exact and scientific, just as are the laws governing gravitation and
electricity. An understanding of this law takes the foundation of Christianity
out of the realm of superstition and credulity and places it upon the firm rock
of scientific understanding. 
</p>

<p>
But, unfortunately, there are comparatively few persons who know how to pray.
They understand that there are laws governing electricity, mathematics, and
chemistry, but, for some inexplicable reason, it never seems to occur to them
that there are also spiritual laws, and that these laws are also definite,
scientific, exact, and operate with immutable precision. 
</p>

<h1>PART TWENTY-ONE</h1>

<p>
1. The real secret of power is consciousness of power. The Universal Mind is
unconditional; therefore, the more conscious we become of our unity with this
mind, the less conscious we shall become of conditions and limitations, and as
we become emancipated or freed from conditions we come into a realization of the
unconditional. We have become free!
</p>

<p>
2. As soon as we become conscious of the inexhaustible power in the world
within, we begin to draw on this power and apply and develop the greater
possibilities which this discernment has realized, because whatever we become
conscious of, is invariably manifested in the objective world, is brought forth
into tangible expression. 
</p>

<p>
3. This is because the Infinite mind, which is the source from which all things
proceed, is one and indivisible, and each individual is a channel whereby this
Eternal Energy is being manifested. Our ability to think is our ability to act
upon this Universal substance, and what we think is what is created or produced
in the objective world. 
</p>

<p>
4. The result of this discovery is nothing less than marvelous, and means that
mind is extraordinary in quality, limitless in quantity, and contains
possibilities without number. To become conscious of this power is to become a
"live wire"; it has the same effect as placing an ordinary wire in contact with
a wire that is charged. The Universal is the live wire. It carries power
sufficient to meet every situation which may arise in the life of every
individual. When the individual mind touches the Universal Mind it receives all
the power it requires. This is the world within. All science recognizes the
reality of this world, and all power is contingent upon our recognition of this
world.
</p>

<p>
5. The ability to eliminate imperfect conditions depends upon mental action, and
mental action depends upon consciousness of power; therefore, the more conscious
we become of our unity with the source of all power, the greater will be our
power to control and master every condition. 
</p>

<p>
6. Large ideas have a tendency to eliminate all smaller ideas so that it is well
to hold ideas large enough to counteract and destroy all small or undesirable
tendencies. This will remove innumerable petty and annoying obstacles from your
path. You also become conscious of a larger world of thought, thereby increasing
your mental capacity as well as placing yourself in position to accomplish
something of value.
</p>

<p>
7. This is one of the secrets of success, one of the methods of organizing
victory, one of the accomplishments of the Master-mind. He thinks big thoughts.
The creative energies of mind find no more difficulty in handling large
situations, than small ones. Mind is just as much present in the Infinitely
large as in the Infinitely small. 
</p>

<p>
8. When we realize these facts concerning mind we understand how we may bring
ourselves any condition by creating the corresponding conditions in our
consciousness, because everything which is held for any length of time in the
consciousness, eventually becomes impressed upon the subconscious and thus
becomes a pattern which the creative energy will wave into the life and
environment of the individual. 
</p>

<p>
9. In this way conditions are produced and we find that our lives are simply the
reflection of our predominant thoughts, our mental attitude; we see then that
the science of correct thinking is the one science, that it includes all other
sciences. 
</p>

<p>
10. From this science we learn that every thought creates an impression on the
brain, that these impressions create mental tendencies, and these tendencies
create character, ability and purpose, and that the combined action of
character, ability and purpose determines the experiences with which we shall
meet in life. 
</p>

<p>
11. These experiences come to us through the law of attraction; through the
action of this law we meet in the world without the experiences which correspond
to our world within. 
</p>

<p>
12. The predominant thought or the mental attitude is the magnet, and the law is
that “like attracts like”, consequently the mental attitude will invariably
attract such conditions as correspond to its nature. 
</p>

<p>
13. This mental attitude is our personality and is composed of the thoughts
which we have been creating in our own mind; therefore, if we wish a change in
conditions all that is necessary is to change our thought; this will in turn
change our mental attitude, which will in turn change our personality, which
will in turn change the persons, things and conditions, or, the experiences with
which we meet in life. 
</p>

<p>
14. It is, however, no easy matter to change the mental attitude, but by
persistent effort it may be accomplished; the mental attitude is patterned after
the mental pictures which have been photographed on the brain; if you do not
like the pictures, destroy the negatives and create new pictures; this is the
art of visualization. 
</p>

<p>
15. As soon as you have done this you will begin to attract new things, and the
new things will correspond to the new pictures. To do this: impress on the mind
a perfect picture of the desire which you wish to have objectified and continue
to hold the picture in mind until results are obtained. 
</p>

<p>
16. If the desire is one which requires determination, ability, talent, courage,
power or any other spiritual power, these are necessary essentials for your
picture; build them in; they are the vital part of the picture; they are the
feeling which combines with thought and creates the irresistible magnetic power
which draws the things you require to you. They give your picture life, and life
means growth, and as soon as it beings to grow, the result is practically
assured. 
</p>

<p>
17. Do not hesitate to aspire to the highest possible attainments in anything
you may undertake, for the mind forces are ever ready to lend themselves to a
purposeful will in the effort to crystallize its highest aspirations into acts,
accomplishments, and events. 
</p>

<p>
18. An illustration of how these mind forces operate is suggested by the method
in which all our habits are formed. We do a thing, then do it again, and again,
and again, until it becomes easy and perhaps almost automatic; and the same rule
applies in breaking any and all bad habits; we stop doing a thing, and then
avoid it again, and again until we are entirely free from it; and if we do fail
now and then, we should by no means lose hope, for the law is absolute and
invincible and gives us credit for every effort and every success, even though
our efforts and successes are perhaps intermittent. 
</p>

<p>
19. There is no limit to what this law can do for you; dare to believe in your
own idea; remember that Nature is plastic to the ideal; think of the ideal as an
already accomplished fact. 
</p>

<p>
20. The real battle of life is one of ideas; it is being fought out by the few
against the many; on the one side is the constructive and creative thought, on
the other side the destructive and negative thought; the creative thought is
dominated by an ideal, the passive thought is dominated by appearances. On both
sides are men of science, men of letters, and men of affairs.
</p>

<p>
21. On the creative side are men who spend their time in laboratories, or over
microscopes and telescopes, side by side with the men who dominate the
commercial, political, and scientific world; on the negative side or men who
spend their time investigating law and precedent, men who mistake theology for
religion, statesmen who mistake might for right, and all the millions who seem
to prefer precedent to progress, who are eternally looking backward instead of
forward, who see only the world without, but know nothing of the world within. 
</p>

<p>
22. In the last analysis there are but these two classes; all men will have to
take their place on one side or the other; they will have to go forward, or go
back; there is no standing still in a world where all is motion; it is this
attempt to stand still that gives sanction and force to arbitrary and unequal
codes of law. 
</p>

<p>
23. That we are in a period of transition is evidenced by the unrest which is
everywhere apparent. The complaint of humanity is as a roll of heaven's
artillery, commencing with low and threatening notes and increasing until the
sound is sent from cloud to cloud, and the lightning splits the air and earth.
</p>

<p>
24. The sentries who patrol the most advanced outposts of the Industrial,
Political, and Religious world are calling anxiously to each other. What of the
night? The danger and insecurity of the position they occupy and attempt to hold
is becoming more apparent every hour. The dawn of a new era necessarily declares
that the existing order of things cannot much longer be.
</p>

<p>
25. The issue between the old regime and the new, the crux of the social
problem, is entirely a question of conviction in the minds of the people as to
the nature of the Universe. When they realize that the transcendent force of
spirit or mind of the Cosmos is within each individual, it will be possible to
frame laws that shall consider the liberties and rights of the many instead of
the privileges of the few. 
</p>

<p>
26. As long as the people regard the Cosmic power as a power non-human and alien
to humanity, so long will it be comparatively easy for a supposed privileged
class to rule by Divine right in spite of every protest of social sentiment. The
real interest of democracy is therefore to exalt, emancipate and recognize the
divinity of the human spirit. To recognize that all power is from within. That
no human being has any more power than any other human being, except such as may
willingly be delegated to him. The old regime would have us believe that the law
was superior to the law-makers; herein is the gist of the social crime of every
form of privilege and personal inequality, the institutionalizing of the
fatalistic doctrine of Divine election. 
</p>

<p>
27. The Divine Mind is the Universal Mind; it makes no exceptions, it plays no
favorites; it does not act through sheer caprice or from anger, jealousy or
wrath; neither can it be flattered, cajoled or moved by sympathy or petition to
supply man with some need which he thinks necessary for his happiness or even
his existence. The Divine Mind makes no exceptions in favor any individual; but
when the individual understands and realizes his Unity with the Universal
principle he will appear to be favored because he will have found the source of
all health, all wealth, and all power. 
</p>

<p>
28. For your exercise this week, concentrate on the Truth. Try to realize that
the Truth shall make you free, that is, nothing can permanently stand in the way
of your perfect success when you learn to apply the scientifically correct
thought methods and principles. Realize that you are externalizing in your
environment your inherent soul potencies. Realize that the Silence offers an
ever available and almost unlimited opportunity for awakening the highest
conception of Truth. Try to comprehend that Omnipotence itself is absolute
silence, all else is change, activity, limitation. Silent thought concentration
is therefore the true method of reaching, awakening, and then expressing the
wonderful potential power of the world within. 
</p>

"The possibilities of thought training are infinite, its consequence eternal,
and yet few take the pains to direct their thinking into channels that will do
them good, but instead leave all to chance." - Marden
