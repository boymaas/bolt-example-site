<h1>INTRODUCTION - PART SEVENTEEN</h1>

<p>
The kind of Deity which a man, consciously or unconsciously, worships, indicates
the intellectual status of the worshipper.
</p>

<p>
Ask the Indian of God, and he will describe to you a powerful chieftain of a
glorious tribe. Ask the Pagan of God, and he will tell you of a God of fire, a
God of water, a god of this, that, and the other.
</p>

<p>
Ask the Israelite of God, and he will tell you of the God of Moses, who
conceived it expedient to rule by coercive measures; hence, the Ten
Commandments. Or of Joshua, who led the Israelites into battle, confiscated
property, murdered the prisoners, and laid waste to cities. 
</p>

<p>
The so-called heathen made "graven images" of their Gods, whom they were
accustomed to worship, but among the most intelligent, at least, these images
were but the visible fulcrums with which they were enabled to mentally
concentrate on the qualities which they desired to externalize in their lives. 
</p>

<p>
We of the twenty-first century worship a God of Love in theory, but in practice
we make for ourselves "graven images" of "Wealth," "Power," "Fashion," "Custom"
and "Conventionality." We "fall down" before them and worship them. We
concentrate on them and they are thereby externalized in our lives.
</p>

<p>
The student who masters the contents of Part Seventeen will not mistake the
symbols for the reality; he will be interested in causes, rather than effects.
He will concentrate on the realities of life, and will then not be disappointed
in the results.
</p>

<h1>PART SEVENTEEN</h1>

<p>
1. We are told that Man has "dominion over all things"; this dominion is
established through Mind. Thought is the activity which controls every principle
beneath it. The highest principle by reason of its superior essence and
qualities necessarily determines the circumstances, aspects and relation of
everything with which it comes in contact.
</p>

<p>
2. The vibrations of Mental forces are the finest and consequently the most
powerful in existence. To those who perceive the nature and transcendency of
mental force, all physical power sinks into insignificance. 
</p>

<p>
3. We are accustomed to look upon the Universe with a lens of five senses, and
from these experiences our anthropomorphic conceptions originate, but true
conceptions are only secured by spiritual insight. This insight requires a
quickening of the vibrations of the Mind, and is only secured when the mind is
continuously concentrated in a given direction. 
</p>

<p>
4. Continuous concentration means an even, unbroken flow of thought and is the
result of patient, persistent, persevering and well-regulated system. 
</p>

<p>
5. Great discoveries are the result of long-continued investigation. The science
of mathematics requires years of concentrated effort to master it, and the
greatest science -- that of the Mind -- is revealed only through concentrated
effort. 
</p>

<p>
6. Concentration is much misunderstood; there seems to be an idea of effort or
activity associated with it, when just the contrary is necessary. The greatness
of an actor lies in the fact that he forgets himself in the portrayal of his
character, becoming so identified with it, that the audience is swayed by the
realism of the performance. This will give you a good idea of true
concentration; you should be so interested in your thought, so engrossed in your
subject, as to be conscious of nothing else. Such concentration leads to
intuitive perception and immediate insight into the nature of the object
concentrated upon.
</p>

<p>
7. All knowledge is the result of concentration of this kind; it is thus that
the secrets of Heaven and Earth have been wrested; it is thus that the mind
becomes a magnet and the desire to know draws the knowledge, irresistibly
attracts it, makes it your own. 
</p>

<p>
8. Desire is largely subconscious; conscious desire rarely realizes its object
when the latter is out of immediate reach. Subconscious desire arouses the
latent faculties of the mind, and difficult problems seem to solve themselves. 
</p>

<p>
9. The subconscious mind may be aroused and brought into action in any direction
and made to serve us for any purpose, by concentration. The practice of
concentration requires the control of the physical, mental, and physical being;
all modes of consciousness whether physical, mental, or physical, must be under
control. 
</p>

<p>
10. Spiritual Truth is therefore the controlling factor; it is this which will
enable you to grow out of limited attainment and reach a point where you will be
able to translate modes of thought into character and consciousness. 
</p>

<p>
11. Concentration does not mean mere thinking of thoughts, but the transmutation
of these thoughts into practical values; the average person has no conception of
the meaning of concentration. There is always the cry "to have" but never the
cry "to be"; they fail to understand that they cannot have one without the
other, that they must first find the "kingdom" before they can have the "things
added." Momentary enthusiasm is of no value; it is only with unbounded
self-confidence that the goal is reached. 
</p>

<p>
12. The mind may place the ideal a little too high and fall short of the mark;
it may attempt to soar on untrained wings and instead of flying, fall to earth;
but that is no reason for not making another attempt. 
</p>

<p>
13. Weakness is the only barrier to mental attainment; attribute your weakness
to physical limitations or mental uncertainties and try again; ease and
perfection are gained by repetition. 
</p>

<p>
14. The astronomer centers his mind on the stars and they give forth their
secrets; the geologists centers his mind on the construction of the earth and we
have geology; so with all things. Men center their minds on the problems of
life, and the result is apparent in the vast and complex social order of the
day. 
</p>

<p>
15. All mental discovery and attainment are the result of desire plus
concentration; desire is the strongest mode of action; the more persistent the
desire, the more authoritative the revelation. Desire added to concentration
will wrench any secret from nature.
</p>

<p>
16. In realizing great thoughts, in experiencing great emotions that correspond
with great thoughts, the mind is in a state where it appreciates the value of
higher things. 
</p>

<p>
17. The intensity of one moment's earnest concentration and the intense longing
to become and to attain may take you further than years of slow normal and
forced effort; it will unfasten the prison bars of unbelief, weakness, impotence
and self-belittlement, and you will come into a realization of the joy of
overcoming. 
</p>

<p>
18. The spirit of initiative and originality is developed through persistence
and continuity of mental effort. Business teaches the value of concentration and
encourages decision of character; it develops practical insight and quickness of
conclusion. The mental element in every commercial pursuit is dominant as the
controlling factor, and desire is the predominating force; all commercial
relations are the externalization of desire. 
</p>

<p>
19. Many of the sturdy and substantial virtues are developed in commercial
employment; the mind is steadied and directed; it becomes efficient. The
principal necessity is the strengthening of the mind so that it rises superior
to the distractions and wayward impulses of instinctive life and thus
successfully overcomes in the conflict between the higher and lower self.
</p>

<p>
20. All of us are dynamos, but the dynamo of itself is nothing; the mind must
work the dynamo; then it is useful and its energy can be definitely
concentrated. The mind is an engine whose power is undreamed; thought is an
omni-working power. It is the ruler and creator of all form and all events
occurring in form. Physical energy is nothing in comparison with the omnipotence
of thought, because thought enables man to harness all other natural power. 
</p>

<p>
21. Vibration is the action of thought; it is vibration which reaches out and
attracts the material necessary to construct and build. There is nothing
mysterious concerning the power of thought; concentration simply implies that
consciousness can be focalized to the point where it becomes identified with the
object of its attention. As food absorbed is the essence of the body, so the
mind absorbs the object of its attention, gives it life and being. 
</p>

<p>
22. If you concentrate on some matter of importance, the intuitive power will be
set in operation, and help will come in the nature of information which will
lead to success. 
</p>

<p>
23. Intuition arrives at conclusions without the aid of experience or memory.
Intuition often solves problems that are beyond the grasp of the reasoning
power. Intuition often comes with a suddenness that is startling; it reveals the
truth for which we are searching, so directly that it seems to come from a
higher power. Intuition can be cultivated and developed; in order to do this it
must be recognized and appreciated; if the intuitive visitor is given a royal
welcome when he comes, he will come again; the more cordial the welcome the more
frequent his visits will become, but if he is ignored or neglected he will make
his visits few and far apart. 
</p>

<p>
24. Intuition usually comes in the Silence; great minds seek solitude
frequently; it is here that all the larger problems of life are worked out. For
this reason every businessman who can afford it has a private office, where he
will not be disturbed; if you cannot afford a private office you can at least
find somewhere, where you can be alone a few minutes each day, to train the
thought along lines which will enable you to develop that invincible power which
is necessary to achieve. 
</p>

<p>
25. Remember that fundamentally the subconscious is omnipotent; there is no
limit to the things that can be done when it is given the power to act. Your
degree of success is determined by the nature of your desire. If the nature of
your desire is in harmony with Natural Law or the Universal Mind, it will
gradually emancipate the mind and give you invincible courage. 
</p>

<p>
26. Every obstacle conquered, every victory gained, will give you more faith in
your power, and you will have greater ability to win. Your strength is
determined by your mental attitude; if this attitude is one of success, and is
permanently held with an unswerving purpose, you will attract to you from the
invisible domain the things you silently demand.
</p>

<p>
27. By keeping the thought in mind, it will gradually take tangible form. A
definite purpose sets causes in motion which go out in the invisible world and
find the material necessary to serve your purpose. 
</p>

<p>
28. You may be pursuing the symbols of power, instead of power itself. You may
be pursuing fame instead of honor, riches instead of wealth, position instead of
servitude; in either event you will find that they turn to ashes just as you
overtake them. 
</p>

<p>
29. Premature wealth or position cannot be retained because it has not been
earned; we get only what we give, and those who try to get without giving always
find that the law of compensation is relentlessly bringing about an exact
equilibrium. 
</p>

<p>
30. The race has usually been for money and other mere symbols of power, but
with an understanding of the true source of power, we can afford to ignore the
symbols. The man with a large bank account finds it unnecessary to load his
pockets down with gold; so with the man who has found the true source of power;
he is no longer interested in its shams or pretentions. 
</p>

<p>
31. Thought ordinarily leads outwardly in evolutionary directions, but it can be
turned within where it will take hold of the basic principles of things, the
heart of things, the spirit of things. When you get to the heart of things it is
comparatively easy to understand and command them. 
</p>

<p>
32. This is because the Spirit of a thing is the thing itself, the vital part of
it, the real substance. The form is simply the outward manifestation of the
spiritual activity within. 
</p>

<p>
33. For your exercise this week concentrate as nearly as possible in accordance
with the method outlined in this lesson; let there be no conscious effort or
activity associated with your purpose. Relax completely, avoid any thought of
anxiety as to results. Remember that power comes through repose. Let the thought
dwell upon your object, until it is completely identified with it, until you are
conscious of nothing else.
</p>

<p>
34. If you wish to eliminate fear, concentrate on courage.
</p>

<p>
35. If you wish to eliminate lack, concentrate on abundance.
</p>

<p>
36. If you wish to eliminate disease, concentrate on health. 
</p>

<p>
37. Always concentrate on the ideal as an already existing fact; this is the
germ cell, the life principle which goes forth and sets in motion those causes
which guide, direct and bring about the necessary relation, which eventually
manifest in form.
</p>
