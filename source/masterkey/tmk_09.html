<h1>INTRODUCTION - PART NINE</h1>

<p>
In this Part you may learn to fashion the tools by which you may build for
yourself any condition you desire. 
</p>

<p>
If you wish to change conditions you must change yourself. Your whims, your
wishes, your fancies, your ambitions may be thwarted at every step, but your
inmost thoughts will find expression just as certainly as the plant springs from
the seed.
</p>

<p>
Suppose, then, we desire to change conditions, how are we to bring this about?
The reply is simple: By the law of growth. Cause and effect are as absolute and
undeviating in the hidden realm of thought as in the world of material things. 
</p>

<p>
Hold in mind the condition desired; affirm it as an already existing fact. This
indicates the value of a powerful affirmation. By constant repetition it becomes
a part of ourselves. We are actually changing ourselves; are making ourselves
what we want to be. 
</p>

<p>
Character is not a thing of chance, but it is the result of continued effort. If
you are timid, vacillating, self-conscious, or if you are over-anxious or
harassed by thoughts of fear or impending danger, remember that is axiomatic
that "two things cannot exist in the same place at the same time." Exactly the
same thing is true in the mental and spiritual world; so that your remedy is
plainly to substitute thoughts of courage, power, self-reliance and confidence,
for those of fear, lack and limitation.
</p>

<p>
The easiest and most natural way to do this is to select an affirmation which
seems to fit your particular case. The positive thought will destroy the
negative as certainly as light destroys darkness, and the results will be just
as effectual. 
</p>

<p>
Act is the blossom of thought, and conditions are the result of action, so that
you constantly have in your possession the tools by which you will certainly and
inevitably make or unmake yourself, and joy or suffering will be the reward.
</p>

<h1>PART NINE</h1>

<p>
1. There are only three things which can possibly be desired in the "world
without" and each of them can be found in the "world within." The secret of
finding them is simply to apply the proper "mechanism" of attachment to the
omnipotent power to which each individual has access. 
</p>

<p>
2. The three things which all mankind desires and which are necessary for his
highest expression and complete development are Health, Wealth and Love. All
will admit that Health is absolutely essential; no one can be happy if the
physical body is in pain. All will not so readily admit that Wealth is
necessary, but all must admit that a sufficient supply at least is necessary,
and what would be considered sufficient for one, would be considered absolute
and painful lack for another; and as Nature provides not only enough but
abundantly, wastefully, lavishly, we realize that any lack or limitation is only
the limitation which has been made by an artificial method of distribution.
</p>

<p>
3. All will probably admit that Love is the third, or maybe some will say the
first essential necessary to the happiness of mankind; at any rate, those who
possess all three, Health, Wealth, and Love, find nothing else which can be
added to their cup of happiness. 
</p>

<p>
4. We have found that the Universal substance is "All Health," "All Substance"
and "All Love" and that the mechanism of attachment whereby we can consciously
connect with this Infinite supply is in our method of thinking. To think
correctly is therefore to enter into the "Secret Place of the Most High."
</p>

<p>
5. What shall we think? If we know this we shall have found the proper mechanism
of attachment which will relate us to "Whatsoever things we desire." This
mechanism may seem very simple when I give it to you, but read on; you will find
that it is in reality the "Master-Key," the "Alladin's lamp," if you please; you
will find that it is the foundation, the imperative condition, the absolute law
of well-doing, which means, well-being. 
</p>

<p>
6. To think correctly, accurately, we must know the "Truth." The truth then is
the underlying principle in every business or social relation. It is a condition
precedent to every right action. To know the truth, to be sure, to be confident,
affords a satisfaction beside which no other is at all comparable; it is the
only solid ground in a world of doubt, conflict and danger.
</p>

<p>
7. To know the Truth is to be in harmony with the Infinite and Omnipotent power.
To know the truth is, therefore, to connect yourself with a power which is
irresistible and which will sweep away every kind of discord, inharmony, doubt
or error of any kind, because the "Truth is mighty and will prevail." 
</p>

<p>
8. The humblest intellect can readily foretell the result of any action when he
knows that it is based on truth, but the mightiest intellect, the most profound
and penetrating mind loses its way hopelessly and can form no conception of the
results which may ensue when his hopes are based on a premise which he knows to
be false. 
</p>

<p>
9. Every action which is not in harmony with Truth, whether through ignorance or
design, will result in discord, and eventual loss in proportion to its extent
and character. 
</p>

<p>
10. How then are we to know the truth in order to attach this mechanism which
will relate us to the Infinite?
</p>

<p>
11. We can make no mistake about this if we realize that truth is the vital
principle of the Universal Mind and is Omnipresent. For instance, if you require
health, a realization of the fact that the "I" in you is spiritual and that all
spirit is one; that wherever a part is the whole must be, will bring about a
condition of health, because every cell in the body must manifest the truth as
you see it. If you see sickness; they will manifest sickness; if you see
perfection they must manifest perfection. The affirmation, "I am whole, perfect,
strong, powerful, loving, harmonious and happy”, will bring about harmonious
conditions. The reason for this is because the affirmation is in strict
accordance with the Truth, and when truth appears every form of error or discord
must necessarily disappear. 
</p>

<p>
12. You have found that the "I" is spiritual, it must necessarily then always be
no less than perfect, the affirmation. "I am whole, perfect, strong, powerful,
loving, harmonious and happy" is therefore an exact scientific statement. 
</p>

<p>
13. Thought is a spiritual activity and spirit is creative, therefore the result
of holding this thought in mind, must necessarily bring about conditions in
harmony with the thought. 
</p>

<p>
14. If you require Wealth a realization of the fact that the "I" in you is one
with the Universal mind which is all substance, and is Omnipotent, will assist
you in bringing into operation the law of attraction which will bring you into
vibration with those forces which make for success and bring about conditions of
power and affluence in direct proportion with the character and purpose of your
affirmation. 
</p>

<p>
15. Visualization is the mechanism of the attachment which you require.
Visualization is a very different process from seeing; seeing is physical, and
is therefore related to the objective world, the "world without," but
Visualization is a product of the imagination, and is therefore a product of the
subjective mind, the "world within." It therefore possesses vitality; it will
grow. The thing visualized will manifest itself in form. The mechanism is
perfect; it was created by the Master Architect who "doeth all things well," but
unfortunately sometimes the operator is inexperienced or inefficient, but
practice and determination will overcome this defect.
</p>

<p>
16. If you require Love try to realize that the only way to get love is by
giving it, that the more you give the more you will get, and the only way in
which you can give it, is to fill yourself with it, until you become a magnet.
The method was explained in another lesson. 
</p>

<p>
17. He who has learned to bring the greatest spiritual truths into touch with
the so-called lesser things of life has discovered the secret of the solution of
his problem. One is always quickened, made more thoughtful, by his nearness of
approach to great ideas, great events, great natural objects, and great men.
Lincoln is said to have begotten in all who came near him the feeling awakened
when one approaches a mountain, and this sense asserts itself most keenly when
one comes to realize that he has laid hold upon things that are eternal, the
power of Truth. 
</p>

<p>
18. It is sometimes an inspiration to hear from someone who has actually put
these principles to the test, someone who has demonstrated them in their own
life. A letter from Frederick Andrews offers the following insight: 
</p>

<p>
19. I was about thirteen years old when Dr. T. W. Marsee, since passed over,
said to my mother: "There is no possible chance, Mrs. Andrews. I lost my little
boy the same way, after doing everything for him that it was possible to do. I
have made a special study of these cases, and I know there is no possible chance
for him to get well." 
</p>

<p>
20. She turned to him and said: "Doctor, what would you do if he were your boy?"
and he answered, "I would fight, fight, as long as there is a breath of life to
fight for." 
</p>

<p>
21. That was the beginning of a long drawn-out battle, with many ups and downs,
the doctors all agreeing that there was no chance for a cure, though they
encouraged and cheered us the best they could. 
</p>

<p>
22. But at last the victory came, and I have grown from a little, crooked,
twisted, cripple, going about on my hands and knees, to a strong, straight, well
formed man. 
</p>

<p>
23. Now, I know you want the formula, and I will give it to you as briefly and
quickly as I can. 
</p>

<p>
24. I built up an affirmation for myself, taking the qualities I most needed,
and affirming for myself over and over again, "I am whole, perfect, strong,
powerful, loving, harmonious and happy." I kept up this affirmation, always the
same, never varying, till I could wake up in the night and find myself
repeating, "I am whole, perfect, strong, powerful, loving, harmonious and
happy." It was the last thing on my lips at night and the first thing in the
morning. 
</p>

<p>
25. Not only did I affirm it for myself, but for others that I knew needed it. I
want to emphasize this point. Whatever you desire for yourself, affirm it for
others, and it will help you both. We reap what we sow. If we send out thoughts
of love and health, they return to us like bread cast upon the waters; but if we
send out thoughts of fear, worry, jealousy, anger, hate, etc., we will reap the
results in our own lives. 
</p>

<p>
26. It used to be said that man is completely built over every seven years, but
some scientists now declare that we build ourselves over entirely every eleven
months; so we are really only eleven months old. If we build the defects back
into our bodies year after year, we have no one to blame but ourselves. 
</p>

<p>
27. Man is the sum total of his own thoughts; so the question is, how are we
going to entertain only the good thoughts and reject the evil ones? At first we
can't keep the evil thoughts from coming, but we can keep from entertaining
them. The only way to do this is to forget them -- which means, get something
for them. This is where the ready-made affirmation comes into play. 
</p>

<p>
28. When a thought of anger, jealousy, fear or worry creeps in, just start your
affirmation going. The way to fight darkness is with light -- the way to fight
cold is with heat -- the way to overcome evils is with good. For myself, I never
could find any help in denials. Affirm the good, and the bad will vanish. -
Frederick Elias Andrews 
</p>

<p>
29. If there is anything you require, it will be well for you to make use of
this affirmation; it cannot be improved upon. Use it just as it is; take it into
the silence with you, until it sinks into your subconsciousness, so that you can
use it anywhere, in your car, in the office, at home; this is the advantage of
spiritual methods; they are always available. Spirit is omnipresent, every
ready; all that is required is a proper recognition of its omnipotence, and a
willingness or desire to become the recipient of its beneficent effects. 
</p>

<p>
30. If our predominant mental attitude is one of power, courage, kindliness and
sympathy, we shall find that our environment will reject conditions in
correspondence with these thoughts; if it is weak, critical, envious and
destructive, we shall find our environment reflecting conditions corresponding
to these thoughts. 
</p>

<p>
31. Thoughts are causes and conditions are effects. Herein is the explanation of
the origin of both good and evil. Thought is creative and will automatically
correlate with its object. This is a Cosmological law (a universal law), the law
of Attraction, the law of Cause and Effect; the recognition and application of
this law will determine both beginning and end; it is the law by which in all
ages and in all times the people were led to believe in the power of prayer. "As
thy faith is, so be it unto thee," is simply another, shorter and a better way
of stating it. 
</p>

<p>
32. This week visualize a plant; take a flower, the one you most admire, bring
it from the unseen into the seen, plant the tiny seed, water it, care for it,
place it where it will get the direct rays of the morning sun, see the seed
burst; it is now a living thing, something which is alive and beginning to
search for the means of subsistence. See the roots penetrating the earth, watch
them shoot out in all directions and remember that they are living cells
dividing and subdividing, and that they will soon number millions, that each
cell is intelligent, that it knows what is wants and knows how to get it. See
the stem shoot forward and upward, watch it burst through the surface of the
earth, see it divide and form branches, see how perfect and symmetrical each
branch is formed, see the leaves begin to form, and then the tiny stems, each
one holding aloft a bud, and as you watch you see the bud begin to unfold and
your favorite flower comes to view; and now if you will concentrate intently you
will become conscious of a fragrance; it is the fragrance of the flower as the
breeze gently sways the beautiful creation which you have visualized. 
</p>

<p>
33. When you are enabled to make your vision clear and complete you will be
enabled to enter into the spirit of a thing; it will become very real to you;
you will be learning to concentrate and the process is the same, whether you are
concentrating on health, a favorite flower, an ideal, a complicated business
proposition or any other problem of life.
</p>

<p>
34. Every success has been accomplished by persistent concentration upon the
object in view.
