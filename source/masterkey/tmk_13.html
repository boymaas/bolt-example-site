<h1>INTRODUCTION - PART THIRTEEN </h1>

<p>
Physical science is responsible for the marvelous age of invention in which we
are now living, but spiritual science is now setting out on a career whose
possibilities no one can fortell.
</p>

<p>
Spiritual science has previously been the football of the uneducated, the
superstitious, the mystical, but men are now interested in definite methods and
demonstrated facts only.
</p>

<p>
We have come to know that thinking is a spiritual process, that vision and
imagination preceded action and event, that the day of the dreamer has come. The
following lines by Mr. Herbert Kaufman are interesting in this connection. 
</p>

<p>
"They are the architects of greatness, their vision lies within their souls,
they peer beyond the veils and mists of doubt and pierce the walls of unborn
Time. The belted wheel, the trail of steel, the churning screw, are shuttles in
the loom on which they weave their magic tapestries. Makers of Empire, they have
fought for bigger things than crowns and higher seats than thrones. Your homes
are set upon the land a dreamer found. The pictures on its walls are visions
from a dreamer's soul.
</p>

<p>
They are the chose few -- the blazers of the way. Walls crumble and Empires
fall, the tidal wave sweeps from the sea and tears a fortress from its rocks.
The rotting nations drop off from Time's bough, and only things the dreamer's
make live on." 
</p>

<p>
Part Thirteen which follows tells why the dreams of the dreamer come true. It
explains the law of causation by which dreamers, inventors, authors, financiers,
bring about the realization of their desires. It explains the law by which the
thing pictured upon our mind eventually becomes our own. 
</p>

<h1>PART THIRTEEN</h1>

<p>
1. It has been the tendency, and, as might be proved, a necessity for science to
seek the explanation of everyday facts by a generalization of those others which
are less frequent and form the exception. Thus does the eruption of the volcano
manifest the heat which is continually at work in the interior of the earth and
to which the latter owes much of her configuration. 
</p>

<p>
2. Thus does the lightning reveal a subtle power constantly busy to produce
changes in the inorganic world, and, as dead languages now seldom heard were
once ruling among the nations, so does a giant tooth in Siberia, or a fossil in
the depth of the earth, not only bear record of the evolution of past ages, but
thereby explains to us the origin of the hills and valleys which we inhabit
today. 
</p>

<p>
3. In this way a generalization of facts which are rare, strange, or form the
exception, has been the magnetic needle guiding to all the discoveries of
inductive science. 
</p>

<p>
4. This method is founded upon reason and experience and thereby destroyed
superstition, precedent and conventionality. 
</p>

<p>
5. It is almost three-hundred years since Lord Bacon recommended this method of
study, to which the civilized nations owe the greater part of their prosperity
and the more valuable part of their knowledge; purging the mind from narrow
prejudices, denominated theories, more effectually than by the keenest irony;
calling the attention of men from heaven to earth more successfully by
surprising experiments than by the most forcible demonstration of their
ignorance; educating the inventive faculties more powerfully by the near
prospect of useful discoveries thrown open to all, than by talk of bringing to
light the innate laws of our mind. 
</p>

<p>
6. The method of Bacon has seized the spirit and aim of the great philosophers
of Greece and carried them into effect by the new means of observation which
another age offered; thus gradually revealing a wondrous field of knowledge in
the infinite space of astronomy, in the microscopic egg of embryology, and the
dim age of geology; disclosing an order of the pulse which the logic of
Aristotle could never have unveiled, and analyzing into formerly unknown
elements the material combinations which no dialectic of the scholastics could
force apart. 
</p>

<p>
7. It has lengthened life; it has mitigated pain; it has extinguished diseases;
it has increased the fertility of the soil; it has given new securities to the
mariner; it has spanned great rivers with bridges of form unknown to our
fathers; it has guided the thunderbolt from heaven to earth; it has lighted up
night with the splendor of day; it has extended the range of human vision; it
has multiplied the power of the human muscles; it has accelerated motion; it has
annihilated distance; it has facilitated intercourse, correspondence, all
friendly offices, all dispatch of business; it has enabled men to descend into
the depths of the sea, to soar into the air, to penetrate securely into the
noxious recesses of the earth. 
</p>

<p>
8. This then is the true nature and scope of induction. But the greater the
success which men have achieved in the inductive science, the more does the
whole tenor of their teachings and example impress us with the necessity of
observing carefully, patiently, accurately, with all the instruments and
resources at our command the individual facts before venturing upon a statement
of general laws. 
</p>

<p>
9. To ascertain the bearing of the spark drawn from the electric machine under
every variety of circumstances, that we thus may be emboldened with Franklin to
address, in the form of a kite, the question to the cloud about the nature of
the lightning. To assure ourselves of the manner in which bodies fall with the
exactness of a Galileo, that with Newton we may dare to ask the moon about the
force that fastens it to the earth. 
</p>

<p>
10. In short, by the value we set upon truth, by our hope in a steady and
universal progress, not to permit a tyrannical prejudice to neglect or mutilate
unwelcome facts, but to rear the superstructure of science upon the broad and
unchangeable basis, of full attention paid to the most isolated as well as the
most frequent phenomena. 
</p>

<p>
11. An ever-increasing material may be collected by observation, but the
accumulated facts are of very different value for the explanation of nature, and
as we esteem most highly those useful qualities of men which are of the rarest
occurrence, so does natural philosophy sift the facts and attach a pre-eminent
importance to that striking class which cannot be accounted for by the usual and
daily observation of life. 
</p>

<p>
12. If then, we find that certain persons seem to possess unusual power, what
are we to conclude? First, we may say, it is not so, which is simply an
acknowledgment of our lack of information because every honest investigator
admits that there are many strange and previously unaccountable phenomena
constantly taking place. Those, however, who become acquainted with the creative
power of thought, will no longer consider them unaccountable. 
</p>

<p>
13. Second, we may say that they are the result of supernatural interference,
but a scientific understanding of Natural Laws will convince us that there is
nothing supernatural. Every phenomenon is the result of an accurate definite
cause, and the cause is an immutable law or principle, which operates with
invariable precision, whether the law is put into operation consciously or
unconsciously.
</p>

<p>
14. Third, we may say that we are on "forbidden ground," that there are some
things which we should not know. This objection was used against every advance
in human knowledge. Every individual who ever advanced a new idea, whether a
Columbus, a Darwin, a Galileo, a Fulton or an Emerson, was subjected to ridicule
or persecution; so that this objection should receive no serious consideration;
but, on the contrary, we should carefully consider every fact which is brought
to our attention; by doing this we will more readily ascertain the law upon
which it is based. 
</p>

<p>
15. It will be found that the creative power of thought will explain every
possible condition or experience, whether physical, mental or spiritual.
</p>

<p>
16. Thought will bring about conditions in correspondence with the predominant
mental attitude. Therefore, if we fear disaster, as fear is a powerful form of
thought, disaster will be the certain result of our thinking. It is this form of
thought which frequently sweeps away the result of many years of toil and
effort. 
</p>

<p>
17. If we think of some form of material wealth we may secure it. By
concentrated thought the required conditions will be brought about, and the
proper effort put forth, which will result in bringing about the circumstances
necessary to realize our desires; but we often find that when we secure the
things we thought we wanted, they do not have the effect we expected. That is,
the satisfaction is only temporary, or possibly is the reverse of what we
expected. 
</p>

<p>
18. What, then, is the proper method of procedure? What are we to think in order
to secure what we really desire? What you and I desire, what we all desire, what
every one is seeking, is Happiness and Harmony. If we can be truly happy we
shall have everything the world can give. If we are happy ourselves we can make
others happy. 
</p>

<p>
19. But we cannot be happy unless we have, health, strength, congenial friends,
pleasant environment, sufficient supply, not only to take care of our
necessities but to provide for those comforts and luxuries to which we are
entitled.
</p>

<p>
20. The old orthodox way of thinking was to be "a worm," to be satisfied with
our portion whatever it is; but the modern idea is to know that we are entitled
to the best of everything, that the "Father and I are one" and that the "Father"
is the Universal Mind, the Creator, the Original Substance from which all things
proceed. 
</p>

<p>
21. Now admitting that his is all true in theory, and it has been taught for two
thousand years, and is the essence of every system of Philosophy or Religion,
how are we to make it practical in our lives? How are we to get the actual,
tangible results here and now? 
</p>

<p>
22. In the first place, we must put our knowledge into practice. Nothing can be
accomplished in any other way. The athlete may read books and lessons on
physical training all his life, but unless he begins to give out strength by
actual work he will never receive any strength; he will eventually get exactly
what he gives; but he will have to give it first. It is exactly the same with
us; we will get exactly what we give, but we shall have to give it first. It
will then return to us many fold, and the giving is simply a mental process,
because thoughts are causes and conditions are effects; therefore in giving
thoughts of courage, inspiration, health or help of any kind we are setting
causes in motion which will bring about their effect. 
</p>

<p>
23. Thought is a spiritual activity and is therefore creative, but make no
mistake, thought will create nothing unless it is consciously, systematically,
and constructively directed; and herein is the difference between idle thinking,
which is simply a dissipation of effort, and constructive thinking, which means
practically unlimited achievement. 
</p>

<p>
24. We have found that everything we get comes to us by the Law of Attraction. A
happy thought cannot exist in an unhappy consciousness; therefore the
consciousness must change, and, as the consciousness changes, all conditions
necessary to meet the changed consciousness must gradually change, in order to
meet the requirements of the new situation. 
</p>

<p>
25. In creating a Mental Image or an Ideal, we are projecting a thought into the
Universal Substance from which all things are created. This Universal Substance
is Omnipresent, Omnipotent and Omniscient. Are we to inform the Omniscient as to
the proper channel to be used to materialize our demand? Can the finite advise
the Infinite? This is the cause of failure; of every failure. We recognize the
Omnipresence of the Universal Substance, but we fail to appreciate the fact that
this substance is not only Omnipresent, but is Omnipotent and Omniscient, and
consequently will set causes in motion concerning which we may be entirely
ignorant. 
</p>

<p>
26. We can best conserve our interests by recognizing the Infinite Power and
Infinite Wisdom of the Universal Mind, and in this way become a channel whereby
the Infinite can bring about the realization of our desire. This means that
recognition brings about realization, therefore for your exercise this week make
use of the principle, recognize the fact that you are a part of the whole, and
that a part must be the same in kind and quality as the whole; the only
difference there can possibly by, is in degree.
</p>

<p>
27. When this tremendous fact begins to permeate your consciousness, when you
really come into a realization of the fact that you (not your body, but the
Ego), the "I," the spirit which thinks is an integral part of the great whole,
that it is the same in substance, in quality, in kind, that the Creator could
create nothing different from Himself, you will also be able to say, "The Father
and I are one" and you will come into an understanding of the beauty, the
grandeur, the transcendental opportunities which have been placed at your
disposal.

"Increase in me that wisdom <br>
<br>
Which discovers my truest interest, <br>
<br>
Strengthen my resolution <br>
<br>
To perform that which wisdom dictates." <br>
