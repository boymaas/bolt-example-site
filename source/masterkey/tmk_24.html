<h1>INTRODUCTION - PART TWENTY-FOUR </h1>

<p>
Enclosed you will find Part Twenty-four, your final lesson of this course.
</p>

<p>
If you have practiced each of the exercises a few minutes every day, as
suggested, you will have found that you can get out of life exactly what you
wish by first putting into life that which you wish, and you will probably agree
with the student who said: "The thought is almost overwhelming, so vast, so
available, so definite, so reasonable and so usable."
</p>

<p>
The fruit of this knowledge is, as it were, a gift of the Gods; it is the
"truth" that makes men free, not only free from every lack and limitation, but
free from sorrow, worry and care, and, is it not wonderful to realize that this
law is no respector of persons, that it makes no difference what your habit of
thought may be, the way has been prepared.
</p>

<p>
If you are inclined to be religious, the greatest religious teacher the world
has ever known made the way so plain that all may follow. If your mental bias is
toward physical science, the law will operate with mathematical certainty. If
you are inclined to be philosophical, Plato or Emerson may be your teacher, but
in either case, you may reach degrees of power to which it is impossible to
assign any limit.
</p>

<p>
An understanding of this principle, I believe, is the secret for which the
ancient Alchemists vainly sought, because it explains how gold in the mind may
be transmuted into gold in the heart and in the hand. 
</p>

<h1>PART TWENTY-FOUR</h1>

<p>
1. When the scientists first put the Sun in the center of the Solar System and
sent the earth spinning around it, there was immense surprise and consternation.
The whole idea was self-evidently false; nothing was more certain than the
movement of the Sun across the sky, and anyone could see it descend behind the
western hills and sink into the sea; scholars raged and scientists rejected the
idea as absurd, yet the evidence has finally carried conviction in the minds of
all. 
</p>

<p>
2. We speak of a bell as a "sounding body," yet we know that all the bell can do
is to produce vibrations in the air. When these vibrations come at the rate of
sixteen per second, they cause a sound to be heard in the mind. It is also
possible for the mind to hear vibrations up to the rate of 38,000 vibrations per
second. When the number increases beyond this, all is silence again; so that we
know that the sound is not in the bell, it is in our own mind. 
</p>

<p>
3. We speak and even think of the Sun as "giving light." Yet we know it is
simply giving forth energy which produces vibrations in the ether at the rate of
four hundred trillion a second, causing what are termed light waves, so that we
know that we call light is simply a form of energy and that the only light there
is, is the sensation caused in the mind by the motion of the waves. When the
number increases, the light changes in color, each change in color being caused
by shorter and more rapid vibrations; so that although we speak of the rose as
being red, the grass as being green, or the sky as being blue, we know that the
colors exist only in our minds, and are the sensations experienced by us as the
result of the vibrations of light waves. When the vibrations are reduced below
four hundred trillion a second, they no longer affect us as light, but we
experience the sensation of heat. It is evident, therefore, that we cannot
depend upon the evidence of the senses for our information concerning the
realities of things; if we did we should believe that the sun moved, that the
world was flat instead of round, that the stars were bits of light instead of
vast suns.
</p>

<p>
4. The whole range then of the theory and practice of any system of metaphysics
consists in knowing the Truth concerning yourself and the world in which you
live; in knowing that in order to express harmony, you must think harmony; in
order to express health you must think health; and in order to express abundance
you must think abundance; to do this you must reverse the evidence of the
senses. 
</p>

<p>
5. When you come to know that every form of disease, sickness, lack and
limitation are simply the result of wrong thinking, you will have come to know
"the Truth which shall make you free." You will see how mountains may be
removed. If these mountains consist only of doubt, fear, distrust or other forms
of discouragement, they are none the less real, and they need not only to be
removed but to be "cast into the sea." 
</p>

<p>
6. Your real work consists in convincing yourself of the truth of these
statements. When you have succeeded in doing this you will have no difficulty in
thinking the truth, and as has been shown, the truth contains a vital principle
and will manifest itself. 
</p>

<p>
7. Those who heal diseases by mental methods have come to know this truth, they
demonstrate it in their lives and the lives of others daily. They know that
life, health and abundance are Omnipresent, filling all space, and they know
that those who allow disease or lack of any kind to manifest, have as yet not
come into an understanding of this great law. 
</p>

<p>
8. As all conditions are thought creations and therefore entirely mental,
disease and lack are simply mental conditions in which the person fails to
perceive the truth; as soon as the error is removed, the condition is removed. 
</p>

<p>
9. The method for removing this error is to go into the Silence and know the
Truth; as all mind is one mind, you can do this for yourself or anyone else. If
you have learned to form mental images of the conditions desired, this will be
the easiest and quickest way to secure results; if not, results can be
accomplished by argument, by the process of convincing yourself absolutely of
the truth of your statement. 
</p>

<p>
10. Remember, and this is one of the most difficult as well as most wonderful
statements to grasp.... remember that no matter what the difficulty is, no
matter where it is, no matter who is affected, you have no patient but yourself;
you have nothing to do but to convince yourself of the truth which you desire to
see manifested. 
</p>

<p>
11. This is an exact scientific statement in accordance with every system of
Metaphysics in existence, and no permanent results are ever secured in any other
way. 
</p>

<p>
12. Every form of concentration, forming Mental Images, Argument, and
Auto-Suggestion are all simply methods by which you are enabled to realize the
Truth.
</p>

<p>
13. If you desire to help someone, to destroy some form of lack, limitation or
error, the correct method is not to think of the person whom you wish to help;
the intention to help them is entirely sufficient, as this puts you in mental
touch with the person. Then drive out of your own mind any belief of lack,
limitation, disease, danger, difficulty or whatever the trouble might be. As
soon as you have succeeded is doing this the result will have been accomplished,
and the person will be free. 
</p>

<p>
14. But remember that thought is creative and consequently every time you allow
your thought to rest on any inharmonious condition, you must realize that such
conditions are apparent only, they have no reality, that spirit is the only
reality and it can never be less than perfect. 
</p>

<p>
15. All thought is a form of energy, a rate of vibration, but a thought of the
Truth is the highest rate of vibration known and consequently destroys every
form of error in exactly the same way that light destroys darkness; no form of
error can exist when the "Truth" appears, so that your entire mental work
consists in coming into an understanding of the Truth. This will enable you to
overcome every form of lack, limitation or disease of any kind. 
</p>

<p>
16. We can get no understanding of the truth from the world without; the world
without is relative only; Truth is absolute. We must therefore find it in the
"world within." 
</p>

<p>
17. To train the mind to see Truth only is to express true conditions only, our
ability to do this will be an indication as to the progress we are making. 
</p>

<p>
18. The absolute truth is that the "I" is perfect and complete; the real "I" is
spiritual and can therefore never be less than perfect; it can never have any
lack, limitation, or disease. The flash of genius does not have origin in the
molecular motion of the brain; it is inspired by the ego, the spiritual "I"
which is one with the Universal Mind, and it is our ability to recognize this
Unity which is the cause of all inspiration, all genius. These results are far
reaching and have effect upon generations yet to come; they are the pillars of
fire which mark the path that millions follow. 
</p>

<p>
19. Truth is not the result of logical training or of experimentation, or even
of observation; it is the product of a developed consciousness. Truth within a
Caesar, manifests in a Caesar's deportment, in his life and his action; his
influence upon social forms and progress. Your life and your actions and your
influence in the world will depend upon the degree of truth which you are
enabled to perceive, for truth will not manifest in creeds, but in conduct. 
</p>

<p>
20. Truth manifests in character, and the character of a man, should be the
interpretation of his religion, or what to him is truth, and this will in turn
be evidenced in the character of his possession. If a man complains of the drift
of his fortune he is just as unjust to himself as if he should deny rational
truth, though it stand patent and irrefutable. 
</p>

<p>
21. Our environment and the innumerable circumstances and accidents of our lives
already exist in the subconscious personality which attracts to itself the
mental and physical material which is congenial to its nature. Thus our future
being determined from our present, and if there should be apparent injustice in
any feature or phase of our personal life, we must look within for the cause,
try to discover the mental fact which is responsible for the outward
manifestation. 
</p>

<p>
22. It is this truth which makes you "free" and it is the conscious knowledge of
this truth which will enable you to overcome every difficulty. 
</p>

<p>
23. The conditions with which you meet in the world without are invariably the
result of the conditions obtaining in the world within, therefore it follows
with scientific accuracy that by holding the perfect ideal in mind you can bring
about ideal conditions in your environment. 
</p>

<p>
24. If you see only the incomplete, the imperfect, the relative, the limited,
these conditions will manifest in your life; but if you train your mind to see
and realize the spiritual ego, the "I" which is forever perfect and complete,
harmonious; wholesome, and healthful conditions only will be manifested. 
</p>

<p>
25. As thought is creative, and the truth is the highest and most perfect
thought which anyone can think, it is self-evident that to think the truth is to
create that which is true and it is again evident that when truth comes into
being that which is false must cease to be. 
</p>

<p>
26. The Universal Mind is the totality of all mind which is in existence. Spirit
is Mind, because spirit is intelligent. The words are, therefore, synonymous.
</p>

<p>
27. The difficulty with which you have to contend is to realize that mind is not
individual. It is omnipresent. It exists everywhere. In other words, there is no
place where it is not. It is, therefore, Universal. 
</p>

<p>
28. Men have, heretofore, generally used the word "God" to indicate this
Universal, creative principle; but the word "God" does not convey the right
meaning. Most people understand this word to mean something outside of
themselves; while exactly the contrary is the fact. It is our very life. Without
it we would be dead. We would cease to exist. The minute the spirit leaves the
body, we are as nothing. Therefore, spirit is really, all there is of us. 
</p>

<p>
29. Now, the only activity which the spirit possesses is the power to think.
Therefore, thought must be creative, because spirit is creative. This creative
power is impersonal and your ability to think is your ability to control it and
make use of it for the benefit of yourself and others. 
</p>

<p>
30. When the truth of this statement is realized, understood, and appreciated,
you will have come into possession of the Master-Key, but remember that only
those who are wise enough to understand, broad enough to weigh the evidence,
firm enough to follow their own judgment, and strong enough to make the
sacrifice exacted, may enter and partake.
</p>

<p>
31. This week, try to realize that this is truly a wonderful world in which we
live, that you are a wonderful being that many are awakening to a knowledge of
the Truth, and as fast as they awake and come into a knowledge of the “things
which have been prepared for them” they, too, realize that "Eye hath not seen,
nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man," the splendors
which exist for those who find themselves in the Promised Land. They have
crossed the river of judgment and have arrived at the point of discrimination
between the true and the false, and have found that all they ever willed or
dreamed, was but a faint concept of the dazzling reality.
</p>

"Though an inheritance of acres may be bequeathed, an inheritance of knowledge<br>
and wisdom cannot. The wealthy man may pay others for doing his work for him,<br>
but it is impossible to get his thinking done for him by another or to purchase<br>
any kind of self-culture." <br>
