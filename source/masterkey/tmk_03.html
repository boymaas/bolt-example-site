<h1>INTRODUCTION - PART THREE </h1>

<p>
You have found that the Individual may act on the Universal, and that the result
of this action and interaction is cause and effect. Thought, therefore, is the
cause, and the experiences with which you meet in life are the effect. 
</p>

<p>
Eliminate, therefore, any possible tendency to complain of conditions as they
have been, or as they are, because it rests with you to change them and make
them what you would like them to be.
</p>

<p>
Direct your effort to a realization of the mental resources, always at your
command, from which all real and lasting power comes. 
</p>

<p>
Persist in this practice until you come to a realization of the fact that there
can be no failure in the accomplishment of any proper object in life if you but
understand your power and persist in your object, because the mind-forces are
ever ready to lend themselves to a purposeful will, in the effort to crystalize
thought and desire into actions, events and conditions. 
</p>

<p>
Whereas in the beginning of each function of life and each action is the result
of conscious thought, the habitual actions become automatic and the thought that
controls them passes into the realm of the subconscious; yet it is just as
intelligent as before. It is necessary that it become automatic, or
subconscious, in order that the self-conscious mind may attend to other things.
The new actions will, however, in their turn, be come habitual, then automatic,
then subconscious in order that the mind again may be freed from this detail and
advanced to still other activities.
</p>

<p>
When you realize this, you will have found a source of power which will enable
you to take care of any situation in life which may develop.
</p>

<h1>PART THREE</h1>

<p>
1. The necessary interaction of the conscious and subconscious mind requires a
similar interaction between the corresponding systems of nerves. Judge Troward
indicates the very beautiful method in which this interaction is effected. He
says: The cerebro-spinal system is the organ of the conscious mind and the
sympathetic is the organ of the subconscious. The cerebro-spinal is the channel
through which we receive conscious perception from the physical senses and
exercise control over the movements of the body. This system of nerves has its
centre in the brain. 
</p>

<p>
2. The Sympathetic System has its centre in a ganglionic mass at the back of the
stomach known as the Solar Plexus, and is the channel of that mental action
which unconsciously supports the vital functions of the body. 
</p>

<p>
3. The connection between the two systems is made by the vagus nerve which
passes out of the cerebral region as a portion of the voluntary system to the
thorax, sending out branches to the heart and lungs, and finally passing through
the diaphragm, it loses its outer coating and becomes identified with the nerves
of the Sympathetic System, so forming a connecting link between the two and
making man physically a "single entity". 
</p>

<p>
4. We have seen that every thought is received by the brain, which is the organ
of the conscious; it is here subjected to our power of reasoning. When the
objective mind has been satisfied that the thought is true it is sent to the
Solar Plexus, or the brain of the subjective mind, to be made into our flesh, to
be brought forth into the world as reality. It is then no longer susceptible to
any argument whatever. The subconscious mind cannot argue; it only acts. It
accepts the conclusions of the objective mind as final. 
</p>

<p>
5. The Solar Plexus has been likened to the sum of the body, because it is a
central point of distribution for the energy which the body is constantly
generating. This energy is very real energy, and this sun is a very real sun,
and the energy is being distributed by very real nerves to all parts of the
body, and is thrown off in an atmosphere which envelopes the body. 
</p>

<p>
6. If this radiation is sufficiently strong the person is called magnetic; he is
said to be filled with personal magnetism. Such a person may wield an immense
power for good. His presence alone will often bring comfort to the troubled
minds with which he comes in contact. 
</p>

<p>
7. When the Solar Plexus is in active operation and is radiating life, energy
and vitality to every part of the body, and to every one whom he meets, the
sensations are pleasant, the body is filled with health and all with whom he
comes in contact experience a pleasant sensation. 
</p>

<p>
8. If there is any interruption of this radiation the sensations are unpleasant,
the flow of life and energy to some part of the body is stopped, and this is the
cause of every ill to the human race, physical, mental or environmental. 
</p>

<p>
9. Physical because the sun of the body is no longer generating sufficient
energy to vitalize some part of the body; mental because the conscious mind is
dependent upon the subconscious mind for the vitality necessary to support its
thought, and environmental, because the connection between the subconscious mind
and the Universal mind, is being interrupted. 
</p>

<p>
10. The Solar Plexus is the point at which the part meets with the whole, where
the finite becomes Infinite, where the Uncreate becomes create, the Universal
becomes individualized, the Invisible becomes visible. It is the point at which
life appears and there is no limit to the amount of life an individual may
generate from this Solar centre. 
</p>

<p>
11. This centre of energy is Omnipotent because it is the point of contact with
all life and all intelligence. It can therefore accomplish whatever it is
directed to accomplish, and herein lies the power of the conscious mind; the
subconscious can and will carry out such plans and ideas as may be suggested to
it by the conscious mind. 
</p>

<p>
12. Conscious thought, then, is master of this sun centre from which the life
and energy of the entire body flows and the quality of the thought which we
entertain determines the quality of the thought which this sun will radiate, and
the character of the thought which our conscious mind entertains will determine
the character of the thought which this sun will radiate, and the nature of the
thought which our conscious mind entertains will determine the nature of thought
which this sun will radiate, and consequently will determine the nature of the
experience which will result. 
</p>

<p>
13. It is evident, therefore, that all we have to do is let our light shine; the
more energy we can radiate, the more rapidly shall we be enabled to transmute
undesirable conditions into sources of pleasure and profit. The important
question, then, is how to let this light shine; how to generate this energy. 
</p>

<p>
14. Non-resistant thought expands the Solar Plexus; resistant thought contracts
it. Pleasant thought expands it; unpleasant thought contracts it. Thoughts of
courage, power, confidence and hope all produce a corresponding state, but the
one arch enemy of the Solar Plexus which must be absolutely destroyed before
there is any possibility of letting any light shine is fear. This enemy must be
completely destroyed; he must be eliminated; he must be expelled forever; he is
the cloud which hides the sun; which causes a perpetual gloom. 
</p>

<p>
15. It is this personal devil which makes men fear the past, the present and the
future; fear themselves, their friends and their enemies; fear everything and
everybody. When fear is effectually and completely destroyed, your light will
shine, the clouds will disperse and you will have found the source of power,
energy and life. 
</p>

<p>
16. When you find that you are really one with the Infinite power, and when you
can consciously realize this power by a practical demonstration of your ability
to overcome any adverse condition by the power of your thought, you will have
nothing to fear; fear will have been destroyed and you will have come into
possession of your birthright. 
</p>

<p>
17. It is our attitude of mind toward life which determines the experiences with
which we are to meet; if we expect nothing, we shall have nothing; if we demand
much, we shall receive the greater portion. The world is harsh only as we fail
to assert ourselves. The criticism of the world is bitter only to those who
cannot compel room for their ideas. It is fear of this criticism that causes
many ideas to fail to see the light of day.
</p>

<p>
18. But the man who knows that he has a Solar Plexus will not fear criticism or
anything else; he will be too busy radiating courage, confidence, and power; he
will anticipate success by his mental attitude; he will pound barriers to
pieces, and leap over the chasm of doubt and hesitation which fear places in his
path.
</p>

<p>
19. A knowledge of our ability to consciously radiate health, strength and
harmony will bring us into a realization that there is nothing to fear because
we are in touch with Infinite Strength. 
</p>

<p>
20. This knowledge can be gained only by making practical application of this
information. We learn by doing; through practice the athlete comes powerful. 
</p>

<p>
21. As the following statement is of considerable importance, I will put it in
several ways, so that you cannot fail to get the full significance of it. If you
are religiously inclined, I would say, you can let your light shine. If your
mind has a bias toward physical science, I would say you can wake the Solar
Plexus; or, if you prefer the strictly scientific interpretation, I will say
that you can impress your subconscious mind. 
</p>

<p>
22. I have already told you what the result of this impression will be. It is
the method in which you are now interested. You have already learned that the
subconscious is intelligent and that it is creative, and responsive to the will
of the conscious mind. What, then, is the most natural way of making the desired
impression? Mentally concentrate on the object of your desire; when you are
concentrating you are impressing the subconscious. 
</p>

<p>
23. This is not the only way, but it is a simple and effective way, and the most
direct way, and consequently the way in which the best results are secured. It
is the method which is producing such extraordinary results that many think that
miracles are being accomplished. 
</p>

<p>
24. It is the method by which every great inventor, every great financier, every
great statesman has been enabled to convert the subtle and invisible force of
desire, faith and confidence into actual, tangible, concrete facts in the
objective world. 
</p>

<p>
25. The subconscious mind is a part of the Universal mind. The Universal is the
creative principle of the Universe, a part must be the same in kind and quality
as the whole. This means that this creative power is absolutely unlimited; it is
not bound by precedent of any kind, and consequently has no prior existing
pattern by which to apply its constructive principle.
</p>

<p>
26. We have found that the subconscious mind is responsive to our conscious
will, which means that the unlimited creative power of the Universal Mind is
within control of the conscious mind of the individual. 
</p>

<p>
27. When making a practical application of this principle, in accordance with
the exercises given in the subsequent lessons, it is well to remember that it is
not necessary to outline the method by which the subconscious will produce the
results you desire. The finite can not inform the Infinite. You are simply to
say what you desire, not how you are to obtain it. 
</p>

<p>
28. You are the channel by which the undifferentiated is being differentiated,
and this differentiation is being accomplished by appropriation. It only
requires recognition to set causes in motion which will bring about results in
accordance with your desire, and this is accomplished because the Universal can
act only through the individual, and the individual can act only through the
Universal; they are one. 
</p>

<p>
29. For your exercise this week, I will ask you to go one step further. I want
you to not only be perfectly still, and inhibit all thought as far as possible,
but relax, let go, let the muscles take their normal condition; this will remove
all pressure from the nerves, and eliminate that tension which so frequently
produces physical exhaustion. 
</p>

<p>
30. Physical relaxation is a voluntary exercise of the will and the exercise
will be found to be of great value, as it enables the blood to circulate freely
to and from the brain and body.
</p>

<p>
31. Tensions leads to mental unrest and abnormal mental activity of the mind; it
produces worry, care, fear and anxiety. Relaxation is therefore an absolute
necessity in order to allow the mental faculties to exercise the greatest
freedom. 
</p>

<p>
32. Make this exercise as thorough and complete as possible, mentally determine
that you will relax every muscle and nerve, until you feel quiet and restful and
at peace with yourself and the world.
</p>

<p>
33. The Solar Plexus will then be ready to function and you will be surprised at
the result.
